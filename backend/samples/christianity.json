The rise of Christian Nationalism is the greatest threat to Christianity there is. We should not stay silent any longer. We need to call them out and flip tables (metaphorically, I am not talking about anarchy).\n\nWhat was in those Epstein files was very disturbing. God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for similar behavior. Where are the Christian Nationalists on this? Silent as can be. Because they don't care as long as their dear leader remains unscathed. So they aren't Christians. They are idolaters of Trump.\n\nYesterday, my best friend's Dad, who is a pastor, shared an image on Facebook from the Trump video with images of the Obamas on monkeys and AOC on a donkey. It was blatantly racist. That was it for me. I am done.\n\nHis defense was that there was no such thing as racism. It is man-made NAZI propaganda. And we are all one race in God's eyes. He said racism doesn't exist, but discrimination does. Ignoring the fact that discrimination is a by product of racism, and even if racism is a man-made problem, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\n\nI called my friends and we got together and commented into silence, him and his congregants that tried to use the bible to justify this. They are cut from the same cloth as pastors during the Civil War that used the bible in an eisegesis manner to justify slavery.

I know it is full of bigots and bots. While I do not engage bots, I will engage the bigots. I am tired y'all. This is spiritual warfare, and we outnumber them. We need to make our voices heard. Racism and bigotry have no room in Jesus's teachings. I urge others to do the same. I know it is exhausting work, but any work sending out God's message is that.\n\nEdit: Wow! This ballooned. Thank you so much to all who understood this wasn't a political attack, but a request for accountability. We should hold all our brothers and sisters in Christ accountable. No Christian should be supporting racism, pedophilia, rape, human trafficking, or cannibalism. It is a question of morality at this point. Not only should we not support those things, we shouldn't support people who do or who enable them. It really is that simple. For my fellow non-believers, I love y'all! Thank you so much for your thoughtful input as well.\n\nFor those taking offense to this post, I will pray that one day God speaks to your heart and shows you the light. At the end of the day, it isn't political. So stop being so sensitive to that and seeing everything as an attack on you personally.  Jesus commanded us to love one another but to also be accountable. Jesus taught that accountability is a vital aspect of spiritual life. He emphasized personal responsibility for actions, words, and stewardship.

When a spirit of lust tempts you, it takes all your attention and puts it on a sexual thought or feeling. When we are aroused, it makes it hard to flee because it takes all of your attention and all your awareness and puts it on impurity.\n\nThe only way to beat lust is to flee, and to flee is to not dwell on a sexual temptation, thought, or feeling.\n\nYou need to flee and run away and train yourself so that when it happens, you close out the temptation immediately. God gave us His Word to combat this battle. So if you are going through cycles of lust and you want to stop, you have to give all your attention every single second to the Lord and dwell on how you will respond the next time a sexual temptation happens. Be prepared for what you should do in the heat of the moment when all your attention gets drawn to something sinful. You need to flee. That means closing out that thought immediately and running to your Bible to read your favorite verse or going to prayer.\n\nPeople, don’t be lukewarm. You have the power to defeat this; you just have to use the weapons Jesus gave us. The devil tries to make you think you can never stop, and the spirit of disobedience and laziness will try to keep you from getting up and fleeing from that thought.\n\nIf you don’t take this truly as a serious matter, then you can never defeat it. You cannot be lukewarm and defeat lust.\n\nThe only way to defeat lust is to stay alert of the spiritual landscape and to use the weapons God gave you: His Word, His Son, and prayer.\n\nIf you don’t take this seriously, you can never defeat lust.\n\nPsalm 23 says, “I shall not want.”\n\nWhen we are in Jesus, we shall not want to put absolutely anything over Him, because He is everything we need. So when you focus on anything but Jesus, that will make fighting lust impossible, because that is the only way to beat lust.\n\nLust is caused by demonic spirits. You have to be on guard, people. Self-control is everything.\n\nLove you all. You have to take every second seriously. If you don’t, then you will fail. But if you take every second seriously, you can defeat lust.\n\nJesus will help you, but you have to follow Him. You can’t be lazy or lukewarm when temptation strikes.\n\n– Braylon\n\nLove you, brothers and sisters.

But that's the lie.\n\nJoseph understood something we forget: God is always watching. We are never truly alone.\n\nAnd here's what gets me: Joseph clearly felt the temptation. It was real. It was intense. The desire must have been overwhelming. Just like our urges to watch porn or masturbate can feel impossible to resist.\n\nBut Joseph did something radical: he feared God more than he loved satisfying his flesh. He literally ran out of that house and away from the situation.\n\nThat's what we need to do. Run from temptation. Delete the apps (Instagram + Tiktok). Download a blocker (I use Gracen). Put the phone down. Get out of the room. Pick up a bible. Whatever it takes.\n\nAnd look at what happened because Joseph stayed faithful: God eventually made him the second most powerful man in all of Egypt.

It would be those who use his name as a shield for exclusion and hate, literally taking his name in vain.\n\nThat pattern isn’t new. The Gospels repeatedly show Jesus clashing with religious insiders who were convinced they were righteous while missing the point. He had far more patience for the confused and struggling than for those certain they were “right” while hurting others.\n\nJesus consistently does what modern culture-war Christianity avoids:\n\nHe centres the marginalised.\n\nHe condemns hypocrisy more harshly than ignorance.\n\nHe treats love as a moral obligation, not a slogan.\n\nWhen he says, “Whatever you did to the least of these, you did to me,” it’s a standard, not a suggestion. By that measure, walking past the homeless, cheering brutality, mocking immigrants, obsessing over racial purity, or justifying children dying over flags or borders isn’t a theological disagreement. It’s a failure. I know nobody is perfect, but we should try our best to be as close and some people are just far from that\n\nJesus spent his time with sinners, outcasts, and those society rejected, loving them without conditions. He didn’t force belief, side with power, or dehumanise others, and that part gets forgotten far too often.\n\nThe core message was simple and hard: love everybody, no buts. Repentance wasn’t about purity or domination seen by the council of Jerusalem, it was about change, humility, and turning toward others. If Jesus were watching a lot of what’s done in his name today, from religious nationalism to racism to justifying violence, he wouldn’t be applauding. He’d probably be saying, “That’s not what I taught.”\n\nJust wanted to put this out there. (Edit: Love the sinner but hate the sin and yes Jesus commanded them to sin no more after, he didn’t hate them for it tho after they repented it treat them harshly before they even repented he preached his word lovingly to all.

My Dad prayed to Jesus Christ that I would be born a healthy baby. By this time I was already dead. 2 minutes after my Dad stopped praying, the doctor ran out and said I was alive again, I was born a Healthy 8 lbs. Baby girl.\n\nMiracle 2.\n\nWhen I was about 9 years old, my cousin (on my Dads side, My Mom Isn’t Mexican.) got kidnapped In Mexico. The kidnappers were asking for 200k dollars. My aunt asked my Mom If we could go to her home to pray for my Cousin to be back Home safely. We all went and gathered Into a circle holding hands, My Mom, Me, My Aunt, and my Little Brother. We started praying In the name of Jesus Christ to bring my Cousin back home, where He was safe. After we stopped praying, not even 5 minutes later, My Aunt got a call. The kidnappers threw my cousin out of their truck and drove off. My cousin returned back home safely. \n\nMiracle 3.\n\nWhen I was 12, I started 🔪 myself. I hated my life, as much as I believed In God, I’d cuss Him out for not helping me out of the darkness that I was In. One day, I was getting ready to h@ng myself. And all of a sudden I hear faint whispers. “Don’t do It my Child. My plan for you Isn’t over yet.” I said, “who are you?” “The way, The Truth, The Life.” “What’s your name?” “Jesus Christ.” As soon as I heard that I started crying like crazy.\n\nMiracle 4.\n\nBy age 14, I started craving God like crazy. I felt a deep connection to Him, I never stopped thinking about Him. I was studying Christianity and the Bible. I started debating with athiests, Muslims, Hindus.. etc.\n\nI gave my life to Jesus Christ. I remember getting on my knees. And crying. “Lord I forgive …. For ….” “Lord forgive me for …” “In Jesus’ name. Amen.” After I did this, for the first time In my entire life. I started getting dreams… signs.. and I knew It was all from God.\n\nMiracle 5. I was 14. I was getting abu$ed by my Dad. The abu$e started when I was abt 8 years old. I had gotten 🍇d by and uncle and My Dad hated my guts for It, the day I told Him He shook my head. Beat me with a belt. And when I threw up blood from Him beating me, He made me clean It up all by myself, an 8 year old little girl. At 14, I went to a healing mass with my aunt (I’m Catholic.) I needed Jesus’ saving from the abu$e. So when the Priest came up to me, He started Praying for me, He kept repeating the words, “Lord Jesus save this Child from all abu$e and Violence In her home.” My Dad was a different man. He started treating me correctly, we started developing a Father-Daughter relationship. He stopped beating me. We started having conversations. He apologized for the abu$e. And all thanks to God.\n\nDream 1.\n\nAt age 12, I dreamt that I was on a hospital bed, dying. When I “died” I woke up In front of the gates of Heaven. And I heard Jesus say, “Open the gates for My Blessed Daughter.” An angel opened up the gates. Mary was there, a toddler, almost like Baby Jesus was there. Joseph was there, Archangel Michael was there, Ángel Gabriel was there, Jesus Christ was there, The Father was there. I remember looking at Him and He was so bright, I couldn’t see His face because It was the light of Heaven. But He was sitting on a Throne. I looked around and everyone was Happy. I looked at Jesus and ran up to Him and hugged Him, then I hugged Mary, Joseph, and the toddler ran up to Me laughing. Then I heard Jesus laugh and say, “Follow me, My Child.” He reached his hand out and I went with Him Into what seemed like a dark portal. We walked In and It was hell. There was a huge endless pit of fire. Naked flesh everywhere. People screaming and crying. I looked at Jesus and said, “Jesus, why don’t you save them?” “It’s too late.” “But, why don’t you give them another chance?” “I gave them billions of chances, they always took them for granted.” “Why send them to hell?” “I didn’t send them here. If anything I tried and tried to get them away from here. But they Ignored Me. They sent themselves here. They beg for more chances. But It’s too late.” “So they sent themselves here?” “Yes. I didn’t. They did. It was their choice.” Then I started crying. “God please give them another chance.” “I can’t my love. I gave them enough.” I hugged Him hard crying. He hugged me back and got on one knee. “Remember this.” He gave me a hug and a kiss on the forehead, and I woke up from my dream.\n\nDream 2.\n\nI was 14 during this time. I was reading the Bible all day. I was tired from reading It and fell asleep. I woke up In a car, my little sister was beside Me. And my Mom was driving the car. All of a sudden I heard trumpets. The Moon turned red, and I knew exactly what this meant. I looked at my sister and she said “The end Is near.” Then she disappeared, and so did my Mom. I started crying and I said “Jesus, Jesus, where are you? Help me Jesus. Please. I’m begging Lord. Have mercy on me.” I woke up reciting those words.\n\nEvery time I let go of God, I would start having demonic nightmares. Nightmares of my Dad beating me, st@bbing me. Nightmares of getting sh0t, nightmares of demons haunting me. \n\nBy 15, I had a friend who was gifted with a Spiritual gift, where He could see my Spirit and Connection to the Lord. He told me I was Insanely connected to God, and that only a few have that connection with Him. He said Gods love, and healing, would shine through me as I grew older. And that I would teach people about Him, He said my experiences would teach others about Him and lead them to Him. \n\nToday, I had a demonic dream again. My Mom was a demon. She was chasing me around and I couldn’t stop running. I ended up In a school and got shot by Her. When I woke up from this nightmare, I saw Jesus In my room. He smiled at me, then waved, and disappeared.\n\nAnyways, I hope y’all know who God really Is. Jesus loves y’all.

The priest saw how I acted and such, and went up to me, asking me if he can guide me to God. \n\nOf course I said yes, thats all I wanted in life. He gave me his phone number and we chatted and called everyday, talking about God and Bible verses, at first it helped me... Until he acted badly weird. \n\nIn 5 months, he changed, he started asking me innapropriate questions and told me things like 'I would love to impregnate you' and started sending me weird ass videos. I called him out and told him that it's pedophile behavior, but he told me that \"Mary was 12 when she was pregnant!\" And stuff like that. \n\nHe began stalking me, EVERYWHERE I WENT. He began seriously blaming me for everything, yelling at me and stuff. He also controlled what I wear, even if I wear modest. Whenever I called him out for something wrong, he blamed me for it, and used Bible verses to defend his behavior... And he also uses bible verses to control me. Like SERIOUSLY control me. I wasn't allowed to see my family, friends or even any male person at all, not even my greatgrandparents. \n\nHe used to touch me weird too.. Please get it what I mean. \n   \nAnd as time passed, I began to get more depressive. I don't want to talk about it, it's traumatizing. \n\nOne day I had enough, I blocked him, and told everyone about what I experienced, but they don't believe me at all. \n\nNo one believes what he did to me, even with the amount of proof I have. \n\nNot even my family. \n\nBecause \"Oh!

You might think I'm pandering, or preaching to the choir, or that I'm fear-mongering in some form or another. \n\nBut I'm not here to yell at conservatives or tell them they're evil for wanting mass deportation. I'm here to start a dialogue, to find common ground, and frankly, starting here is a necessary baseline. Why? \n\nBecause whether or not you think Renee Good was innocent or guilty, whether or not you think ICE is doing the right thing, we cannot avoid a simple fact -- ICE has a serious problem with white nationalism. And no, I'm not about to lib out with some half-baked theory about Jerusalem crosses or 88 foot tall flagpoles, I mean literal, avowed white nationalism. Many of you have seen me make the case in the past that the man in charge of Trump's immigration policy (Stephen Miller) has extremely strong ties to Richard Spencer and VDARE and other white nationalist projects. I stand by that, but things are now happening that are even more overt. Two stories from just *this week*. \n\n\n\n**Exhibit A**\n\n[https://www.texasobserver.org/ice-prosecutor-racist-account-back-at-immigration-court/](https://www.texasobserver.org/ice-prosecutor-racist-account-back-at-immigration-court/)\n\n>In February of last year, the *Texas Observer* [reported](https://www.texasobserver.org/ice-prosecutor-dallas-white-supremacist-x-account/) that James “Jim” Joseph Rodden—an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) assistant chief counsel who acts as a prosecutor for ICE in immigration court in Dallas—operates a white supremacist X account named GlomarResponder.  \n  \nThe account has over 17,000 followers and has routinely posted hateful statements, including that “America is a White nation,” that “‘Migrants’ are all criminals,” and that “All blacks are foreign to my people,” in addition to posts with apparent praise of Adolf Hitler.  \n  \nAfter the *Observer*’s initial story was published, Rodden was apparently [pulled from federal immigration court schedules](https://www.texasobserver.org/investigation-ice-prosecutor-racist-x-account/)\n\nThis story goes on to detail that this individual is back in courts representing ICE. They know his history of publicly praising Hitler, and here he is -- officially representing ICE in the courts. \n\n  \n**Exhibit B**\n\n[https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/white-nationalist-song-ice-recruitment-posts/](https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/white-nationalist-song-ice-recruitment-posts/)\n\n>The social media accounts of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the White House shared a meme and an excerpt from a song produced and popularized by a secretive white nationalist group, according to posts and archival material reviewed by Hatewatch.  \nOn Jan. 9, multiple accounts run by [DHS communications staff](https://www.dhs.gov/social-media-directory) shared an image with the caption “We’ll have our home again” on Facebook and X (the website formerly known as Twitter). The image included the phrase and a picture of a man in a cowboy hat riding through a snowy field as a military plane flies overhead, as well as a link to apply to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\n>On Instagram, the DHS post includes an excerpt from the chorus of the song itself, also called “We’ll Have Our Home Again,” that is attributed to a group called the Pine Tree Riots. The post appeared on both the White House and DHS Instagram feeds.\n\n(skipping a bit)\n\n>The song “We’ll Have Our Home Again” was released by the Pine Tree Riots on YouTube, Spotify and other streaming platforms in 2020. Other songs that the group has produced include one with the lyrics, “Well, another Charlottesville wouldn’t do us any harm,” an apparent reference to the deadly [2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia](https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hatewatch/unite-right-5-years-later-where-are-they-now/), where Klansmen, neo-Nazis, racist skinheads and other white supremacists clashed with protesters, and one extremist murdered an antiracist activist.  \n  \nPine Tree Riots is a little-known a cappella group affiliated with the Mannerbund, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has previously listed as a white nationalist group. The Mannerbund — named after the German word *Männerbund,* meaning an “alliance of men” — is a self-described “fraternity for right-wing men” or “pro-White fraternal order.” Its founders, who operate under the pseudonyms “Nam” and “Apache,” appear to have launched the Mannerbund in late 2019....\n\n(skipping a bit again)\n\n>After DHS shared the song on its social media accounts, an X account called pine\\_tree\\_riots responded to commentators who described the post as a “dog whistle.”\n\n>The account wrote, “its not really a ‘dog whistle’ lmao, its all pretty explicitly laid out in the lyrics.” It added, “the other song that was sung that night and got cleaned up and released was probably slightly more direct, but still.”\n\nThis is an obscure track that is only popular with deeply-online nazis. This isn't the kind of thing you stumble upon accidentally. None of you would claim these guys aren't Nazis, right? They clearly are. The whole idea behind \"having our home again\" is directly connected to purging minorities. As they say themselves, \"it's not really a dog whistle\". \n\nSo *official government* accounts, the very ones responsible for running ICE, they are sharing this, this literal white nationalist propaganda. It isn't the first time either. The article linked above gives other examples. \n\n\n----\n\nSo my question is, why isn't this a scandal? Can't we agree this is disgraceful behavior? White nationalism is an affront to people of conscience everywhere. It devalues the dignity and sacredness of life. It has been used to justify oppressing and murdering people on mass scales. It has been the structure of taunts from the playground to klansman murdering people for simply existing. Proponents of mass deportation have continually reassured me that their interest in immigration had nothing to do with white nationalist anything. They simply want the law enforced. *Fine*. I accept that (I don't agree with it, but at least that's in the realm of normal politics). But that means when high-ranking people in the administration are engaging in white nationalist propaganda, I expect you to be just as loud as me. \n\nOne of the things that deeply upsets me is when people dismiss these kinds of concerns like \"oh they're just trolling\". That isn't fine. People who study white nationalism seriously have been warning for years that these guys hide behind irony the same way klansmen hide behind hoods. Jesus taught us to be sincere: \"let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.\". There are many places where we can be sarcastic, crack jokes, have some dark humor as long as there is mutual understanding. But what happens when the guy you thought was joking about these matters is dead serious? What then? Republicans seem to react to this kind of behavior as if it is merely childish, merely playing games. Does Jim Rodden look like a child to you? Whoever is running the government account for DHS, are they a middle school boy? \n\nThis is serious stuff. Where is  our conscience? What has to happen before Christian ICE supporters can admit this is huge problem? Doesn't this erode the whole premise that mass deportation can be race neutral? If that's a premise you want to defend, shouldn't you be as angry as me? Shouldn't we all work together to do something about this? \n\nIf we cannot agree on this as Christians, can we agree on anything? \n\n", "author": "slagnanz", "score": 368, "num_comments": 739, "created_utc": 1768600235.0, "permalink": "/r/Christianity/comments/1qetcni/this_shouldnt_need_to_be_said_white_nationalism/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qetcni/this_shouldnt_need_to_be_said_white_nationalism/"}, {"id": "1qnfk33", "subreddit": "Christianity", "title": "Economic justice is mentioned 3,000 times in our Scriptures, both the New Testament and the Hebrew Scriptures.

I do find myself believing in God and I do feel as if I have been called by Him in the past to be a follower. For a lot of my life, I've had this sort of gut feel or inclination that there is something or someone supernatural that is looking over us all the time.\n\nThe problem is that, for literally years, I have had to deal with so much mental anguish. I am riddled with constant anxiety, depression, and OCD. I have been suicidal for a very long time, and I just don't see another way.\n\nI am scared of going to Hell. I know that it's pretty selfish of me to just be worried about things like that. I have tried to make this as easy for my family as possible by waiting a while before doing this (we've been busy for the last year or so in moving countries, settling down etc. so I have waited a very long time and have been considerate towards them by waiting this long).\n\nI guess I just really don't see another way out of this. I really just can't see a way of getting better. Also, I know that this isn't my place, but I don't understand why I have been put on this Earth to live in this way. God knows how many hairs are on my head, so he also understands exactly what I have been through. Physically and mentally, I've gone through so much even though I'm only 18. I've had anaphylaxis, lots of other physical problems (eczema, asthma, kidney stones once), and mentally I've been in almost constant stress and/or depression for literally years. I feel like I'm steadily losing my mind, and my grip on reality is getting more and more distant and distorted. I have prayed and asked God what He has put me here for. I don't want to say that he is wrong for giving me these things, because that is not my place. Of course his judgment is perfect. I just struggle to understand it.\n\nI guess if anyone can offer some kind of support or guidance, that would mean a lot to me.

I'd just really like to talk to Christians. Obviously there is so much I do not know. As I have said, I have only recently rekindled by Christian faith. I haven't been to church since I was 10 (I think) and haven't read 95%+ of the Bible. I have prayed to Him quite a bit and I have read and absorbed some of His Word and sermons on the Word etc. When I talk to Him, I try to understand his judgment, and I ask Him questions. I don't feel like those questions have been answered. I don't understand why I am here.\n\nRight now it just feels like if I don't die, I'm going to have to put myself through another 60-70 years of torture. I know that's not a very Christian way of looking at things, and I do want to be a humble follower of God.

It tells the story of Christian prisoners in Romania who were severely tortured and murdered by totalitarian Communists.\n\nIt illustrates the unthinkable depths of depravity and cruelty mankind can sink to when his heart is closed to Love. And it also shows unbelievably the power of Faith in Christ to overcome the most wicked trials that no man, woman, or child should ever have to bear. Here is one quote from *Tortured For Christ*:\n\n>\"When one Christian was sentenced to death, he was allowed to see his wife before being executed. His last words to his wife were, 'You must know that I die loving those who kill me. They don't know what they do and my last request of you is to love them, too. Don't have bitterness in your heart because they killed your beloved one. We will meet in heaven.'\"\n\nI cannot recommend this book deeply enough. It repeatedly causes me to weep. Never have I encountered a more visceral portrait of the hell mankind is capable of sinking to, nor of the power of Love, Grace, God, and Faith as the antidote to mankind’s miseries. I pray wholeheartedly for the day mankind fully remembers Love and we finally put an end to all hideous brutality on Earth. Lord help us. 🙏🏼\n\nGod Bless You,\n\nJordan\n\nP.S. The book can be accessed freely online [here](https://www.orcuttchristian.org/Wurmbrand_Tortured%20for%20Christ.pdf).\n\n——\n\nEDIT: Some people have responded to this by criticizing Richard Wurmbrand, noting that Christians have also done awful things, or making this about group identity. To these commenters I'd like to kindly say:\n\nMy friends, I'd humbly suggest you missed the point here. This book is not primarily about Richard Wurmbrand. It is about all of us. If you read the book, I am nearly certain you would have a different perspective.\n\nYou're correct that Christians have also done horrible things. The point here is not to play one group off another. It is to confront the evil mankind is capable of, and to let that rip our hearts open, rather than harden them.\n\nJesus Christ told us to love and forgive our enemies — not to rape them, cut holes in their body with knives, burn them repeatedly, freeze them in ice boxes, defecate on them, and slowly beat them to death. Such are the wicked acts described in *Tortured For Christ.*\n\nIf these events happened to Muslims, atheists, or any other group, they would be equally horrific. A book like this is evidence of evil tragedy beyond words.\n\nI read *Man's Search for Meaning* years ago, about the Holocaust, and had a similar experience. We must be willing to confront the evil humanity is capable of; otherwise we will not understand how deep Love truly must go to be able to hold all beings in its embrace.\n\nTo know that human beings are capable of doing this to one another, brings me heartrending sorrow. It is vital that we read these types of accounts, to understand the depths of darkness on Earth.\n\nAnd equally important, in a book like this, is to read the unbelievable acts of courage, faith, and love demonstrated by people who were imprisoned and tortured in conditions worse than all imagining.\n\nThese people showed unfathomable bravery in demonstrating the all-forgiving Love that would truly be necessary to break the endless cycles of violence and vengeance on Earth. And that is something worth reading about, and contemplating, no matter where the example comes from.\n\nI'm reminded of the Buddhist monks who selflessly set their own bodies on fire during the Vietnam war, sitting perfectly still as they burned to death, so as to viscerally show the world the self-violence mankind is inflicting upon himself.

While we have conversations daily about these things, there is something that keeps popping up to which I feel as though it is vitally important to respond to. \n\nTo preface, I am not an expert on authoritarianism. I have studied and read up on it, but please feel free to correct me on anything I might have missed here. \n\nI also want to be clear that while I am a moderator and am discussing something that came up during moderation, I am not speaking on behalf of the mod team, nor am I saying that anything is changing with regards to moderation. I am speaking on why I specifically moderate a certain way as well as believe it is important to continue to moderate this way. \n\n\\-----\n\nLately, there was a question regarding why it is okay to call MAGA Nazis, but it is not okay to call protestors \"animals\" or \"domestic terrorists\". On its face, I think this is a fair question. Calling a group Nazis is objectively dangerous for anyone in that group since Nazis are objectively bad. Calling a group animals or domestic terrorists is dehumanizing and dangerous as neither are not meant to be regarded the same as regular people. \n\nThere is a massive difference between these two things though. \"Animals\" is used specifically as a means to dehumanize a group in order to justify the harm that comes to them--putting down an animal who is acting out is far less frowned upon than putting down a human. \"Domestic terrorists\" are seen as people who are bad enough that their killing is a net positive for society. \n\nThe goal of people who want to harm these groups is to find ways to justify their endangerment to those who might be upset otherwise. Now, I want to be clear that I don't think any user I have spoken to, who has used this type of language, want to harm anyone. I think this is specifically a symptom of falling victim to propaganda. I do believe the people creating the propaganda do want these people harmed and want people to believe their justifications. \n\nOn the other hand, users referring to MAGA and supporters or ICE as Nazis is hard to dismiss. ICE has eerily dangerous similarities to the Gestapo and other fascist military loyalists groups, and the Trump administration is in the beginning stages of Authoritarianism that has led to genocides. \n\nI am going to outline these comparisons below:\n\n**\"Us\" vs. \"Them\"**\n\n[https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/critical-education-in-the-age-of-trumps-fascist-politics/](https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/critical-education-in-the-age-of-trumps-fascist-politics/)\n\n>In a similarly revealing display of fascist logic, the Trump administration [claimed that the political left was responsible for the assassination of right-wing youth leader Charlie Kirk, ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/11/charlie-kirk-trump-maga-allies)converting right-wing violence into a pretext for further repression. These fabrications are not random acts of distortion; they are part of a broader strategy that casts dissent as treason and prepares the public for state violence. Accordingly, [the administration has openly declared a war against so-called “enemies within”](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/24/donald-trump-has-built-a-regime-of-retribution-and-reward), a category that increasingly includes communists, leftists, journalists, educators, and anyone who challenges Trump’s authoritarian agenda.\n\nFrom dog whistles plastered on Government images and podiums to the slurred speeches of a man whose mind is being lost in front of the world, the current Trump regime is openly and undoubtedly expressing the same rhetoric used by people like Hitler and Mussolini. \n\n**Attacking Democratic Institutions**\n\nTrump continues to attack the legitimacy of judges who rule against his wishes. He uses the DOJ as a weapon to investigate political opponents (Walz). He challenges the legitimacy of free and fair elections. He removes and replaces heads of agencies with [loyalists ](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/21/trump-world-21-people-to-know-00198691)rather than experts (Military, FCC, FBI, FTC). \n\nHitler did the exact same thing. [He filled his administration with loyalists](https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/the-nazi-rise-to-power/the-nazi-rise-to-power/the-role-of-the-conservative-elite/). He used [emergency powers ](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/reichstag-fire-decree)instead of legal routes. He allowed his cabinet to make laws in order to circumvent legal parliamentary approval. He attacked political opponents, journalists, and citizens who did not conform to what he believed. \n\nTrump is currently breaking the Constitution on two very important issues: [ICE](https://medium.com/@richard.brody/eerie-horrific-similarities-between-ice-gestapo-f094e7fffa1e) and Epstein. DHS sent a memo to [ICE that they can disregard the Constitution](https://thehill.com/homenews/5700861-trump-immigration-enforcement-sweeping-power-memo/) and forcibly break into homes of people without a judicial warrant. [Bondi has failed to release the Epstein files](https://goldman.house.gov/media/press-releases/elon-musk-confirms-rep-dan-goldmans-suspicion-pam-bondi-hiding-epstein-files) despite a unanimous vote by Congress to do just that. These kinds of specific events of ignoring law are not accidents. They are purposeful and dangerous. \n\nMost importantly, he used a loyalist paramilitary group as a means to evoke fear and destruction with impunity, labeling all who were against these actions as \"enemies within\", \"radical\", and \"dangerous\". \n\n**Scapegoating**\n\n[https://www.theunpopulist.net/p/when-politicians-start-scapegoating](https://www.theunpopulist.net/p/when-politicians-start-scapegoating)\n\n>One of the most alarming ghosts \\[from our past\\] is \\[this\\] one: the trend to form winning political coalitions by framing all the problems of society as the result of ﻿the perverse actions of a minority, thus injecting divisiveness into political discourse as a means of unifying the majority against the minority. In *Mein Kampf*, Adolf Hitler explained (years before he came to power) how to take political advantage of divisive circumstances to legitimize destructiveness and impose tyranny:\n\nFascists can never admit defeat. They can never be wrong, and it is always the oppositions fault for anything that can be seen as bad happening under their leadership. [Mussolini ](https://maggotlaw.medium.com/racial-laws-and-the-rise-of-fascism-in-italy-92c69c9dd0ba)targeted socialist and liberals, claiming they were the reason there was corruption. [Hitler ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/scapegoating)blamed the left for causing national unrest and blamed them for the rifts throughout the nation. \n\n**Targeting Minorities**\n\nThe road to genocide is not quick. These things take time, but there are signs to look out for. It took eight years after Hitler rose to power to begin gassing Jews in masse. About three years after taking power, Mussolini began killing tens of thousands of Lybians, Jozef Tiso took about three years after gaining power. \n\n[How most of these fascist genocides began is where we currently are.](https://www.jsonline.com/story/opinion/2025/02/22/trump-mass-deportations-genocide-holocaust-guantanomo-bay/79228150007/) Hitler, Mussolini, Jozef, Romania, etc. all started by deportations, threats of deportations, and holding targeted groups in detention facilities. Almost every genocide in this fashion was preceded by the governing body's ability to overtake all government control. \n\n\\-----\n\nWe are currently in the beginning stages of an authoritarian regime that may result in genocide. The Trump Regime is currently attempting to take full control of the government. They are doing this through executive orders as well as specific actions that ignore the Constitution. Minority groups are already being targeted. They are already being put into detention facilities. They are already being scapegoated and made to be the \"enemy within\".\n\nThis is not an overreaction nor is it some fantasy we are living in. Experts around the world are attempting to yell at what may soon come if we just watch it. Trump has already floated the idea of canceling midterm elections. If that were to happen, we will fully be within an authoritarian regime with the chance of a genocide of immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, and those who disagree with the regime in charge. \n\nSo, when someone here expresses how Trump and his regime are fascists or Nazis, you can refer to this, as well as the many other sources that make this fact clear, as to why that classification is not only correct but important. \n\nWhen someone refers to a group of people as \"animals\" or \"domestic terrorists\", I hope you can better understand why that is something I will want to quickly remove.

By the way.. the video-game I built this in is called *Palia* on the PS5.  Friends also helped with decorating ideas and party gathering hunts!  \n\nHere is another key verse that I believe is magnificently motivational as well..  \n\n**1 Corinthians 1:18**   \n\n*“For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (NRSV:ACE)*   \n\nWith that being said, I added some progress screenshots I took of the project.  All the wood and stone was chopped/mined as well, which each gathered was well in the 100s.  It roughly took about a week to collect and craft into building material.  The placement was the hardest part so it could be perfectly lined up.  The building blocks work similar to *Minecraft* and *Dragon Quest Builders.*  Either way..

At that point, it’s no longer just a private act—it’s shaping your mind and your desires. The truth is: if you can’t fully control it, it will eventually control you.

That year, they asked a simple question: “Do you think an elected official who commits an immoral act in their personal life can still behave ethically and fulfill their duties in their public and professional life?”  \nIn 2011, only 30 percent of white evangelicals agreed with that statement. This made sense—at least on the surface. For decades, evangelicals had insisted that character counts, that personal morality was inseparable from public leadership. During the Clinton years, this conviction was thundered from pulpits and plastered on voter guides. White evangelicals were, in fact, the *least* likely religious group in America to separate private morality from public fitness for office—less likely even than the religiously unaffiliated.  \nThen came 2016.   \nBy October of that year—just weeks after the Access Hollywood tape surfaced, in which Donald Trump bragged about sexual assault—PRRI asked the same question again. This time, 72 percent of white evangelicals agreed that personal immorality was compatible with ethical public leadership.

Christians from other nations put up with Americans posting every three minutes about trump, you can allow a Christian from another nation to grieve a tragedy.\n\nOne educator and five students between 12 and 13 years old were found dead on February 10, 2026, at around 1:20pm GMT-8 at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, in Tumbler Ridge, B.C Canada. \n\nThey were murdered by a former student who dropped out of school and had an expired firearms licence. \n\nTumbler Ridge Secondary School is a Grade 7-12 school. These were children. \n\nThe shooter was transgender, but right now, there is no known or reported motive for the violence. \n\nI feel destroyed. I feel like my soul is shattering like glass. Violence is disgusting and an afront to Jesus.\n\nFrom Genesis to Revelation, violence is never portrayed as neutral. It is a rebellion against God’s design. I know there are Christians in BC. I know that you're angry and feel far more pain then I do in this moment. God has pressed upon my heart to post this scripture here. I hope it helps you. \n\nGod is with you in your anger, in Psalm 11:5 it says, “The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion.”\n\nAs we all know by now, Proverbs 10:6 teaches that violence eventually rebounds on the wicked themselves. The person who harmed you and your community cannot harm you anymore.\n\nRegardless of the shooters reasoning, whether they were bullied or whatever the media ends up saying the reason for the shooting is, Isaiah 59:6–8 condemns societies where violence fills the streets, saying such people do not know the way of peace and therefore cannot expect justice. Nothing anyone can say can justify the pain you are feeling right now. \n\nMost importantly, Romans 12:19–21 reminds us that vengeance belongs to God. He belongs in hell. He sinned against you and you don't have to worry because I full faith that God is good and he will not let this crime go unpunished. \n\nRevelation 21:8 lists the \"violent\" among those excluded from God’s renewed creation. You will never need to see, hear or be near that criminal again.\n\nI hope if you're from BC and youre reading this you feel the love though the screen right now. I'm praying for you and God answers all prayers. \n\nIf you're from somewhere other than Canada, I would ask you to pray for the people in BC as well. If you could post comforting scripture in the comments it would mean the world to me and people from BC. \n\nGod bless and Jesus loves you.

These are not mere \"tips\" or rumors; they are official federal records—FD-302 investigative summaries documenting statements made to federal agents under the weight of law.\n\nThe latest records reveal a disturbing level of proximity and coordination. Federal documents describe Ghislaine Maxwell presenting a woman to Donald Trump at a New York party, providing a \"CV\" of her accolades. \n\n\nThis woman was subsequently invited to Mar-a-Lago for a tour with Trump, while both Epstein and Maxwell were present. Most chilling is the description of Maxwell \"vetting\" the woman’s clothing to suit Trump’s tastes and telling her she was \"lucky\" because Trump \"liked her,\" treating the encounter with the same predatory \"pretext\" used to introduce victims to Epstein.\n\n\nFor too long, a dangerous delusion has gripped the Church: the idea that a leader’s proximity to power justifies a total abandonment of moral scrutiny. By branding a man \"God’s chosen\" while ignoring a documented pattern of predatory associations, believers have traded their spiritual birthright for political access. \n\n\nYou were warned, yet many chose the myth over the manifest fruit.\nThe Scripture is clear: \"By their fruits you will know them\" (Matthew 7:16). The fruit has never been hidden. It is found in the sworn testimony of witnesses describing \"sociopathic\" behavior and a world where people were viewed as \"available\" commodities. \n\nTo ignore this is not \"faith\" it is a conscious decision to look away from evil.\nConsider the spiritual peril of following one who openly declares he has no need for God’s forgiveness. \n\n\nThis is not a \"flaw\"; it is a fundamental rejection of the Gospel. A heart that refuses to repent cannot be a vessel for the Divine, and those who follow such pride are walking a path that leads away from the Cross.\n\n\nThe Church’s witness is in tatters because the world sees a body of believers that values political dominance over the protection of the vulnerable. If your \"discernment\" leads you to defend the indefensible, you must ask yourself what spirit you are actually following. Power is a poor god, and it will eventually demand everything you hold sacred.\n\n\nGrief is insufficient. The current moment demands a harsh, public repentance from those who spiritualized corruption and mocked the voices of the concerned. You cannot wash your hands of the consequences when you helped build the platform for the predator.\n\n\nThe Bible warns of wolves in sheep’s clothing, but it also warns of those who invite the wolves in because they like the way the wolf snarls at their enemies. Stop confusing the pursuit of a Christian nation with the pursuit of Christ. One offers you a temporary kingdom; the other demands your integrity.\n\n\nTruth is not a secondary concern; it is the bedrock of our faith. If the Church does not regain its ability to call evil by its name—regardless of whose \"side\" it is on it forfeits its right to speak to the world. Let this be the final alarm. Discernment is not a suggestion; it is a requirement for your spiritual survival.\n", "author": "Nice_Substance9123", "score": 147, "num_comments": 78, "created_utc": 1769812592.0, "permalink": "/r/Christianity/comments/1qrkfd2/a_warning_to_the_faithful_the_price_of_blindness/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qrkfd2/a_warning_to_the_faithful_the_price_of_blindness/"}, {"id": "1r1gm3u", "subreddit": "Christianity", "title": "I made this bandage thing today", "selftext": "I know it stupid, but i was feeling kinda sad, and i had just torn off my bandage from my knee and when i tore it off i saw a chunk of the bandage that resembled a cross so i just kinda polished it to this, (not perfect)", "author": "One_Reputation_1802", "score": 146, "num_comments": 12, "created_utc": 1770765431.0, "permalink": "/r/Christianity/comments/1r1gm3u/i_made_this_bandage_thing_today/", "url": "https://i.redd.it/di0wjfgr2rig1.jpeg"}, {"id": "1qp76cf", "subreddit": "Christianity", "title": "EXACTLY what I keep trying to tell yall.

She asked me my story and the next time I saw her both her and her dying husband gave me a bible and wrote me a very very kind note of encouragement\n\n2 I saw some nuns in a Walmart once I was having a terrible day at the time. I saw them and they didn't see me and one of the walked up to me and gave me a little medal with an angel on it and told me that I looked like I could use some love and guidance.\n\n3 I left my therapy office the other week like a few days before the big epstein files release. and 2 missionaries approched me and spoke to me about the church (no idea what one) and just said some stuff about how jesus understands and I was left speechless.\n\nit's like I was being shown a truth or given a light in the darkness and I just didn't get it at the time. But I understand now...\n\nWhen the Epstein files recent release essentially confirmed the world is run by pedophiles and money and murder I felt fear overwhelm me. The good I thought must have existed (somewhere) was being snuffed out. I turned to Jesus and begged for a reprieve and he answered my plea at once I was calm and yet I cried my mind was still and yet I cried. But my heart felt so full.\n\nIt has been a very strange feeling and yet I offer myself and bow at Jesus feet for he truly is the king of kings and in his love I felt what I can only describe as salvation.\n\nThis gift I have been given is divine and pure and I never in a million years would have thought I could feel this way.\n\nEdit: Seeing everyone encouraging kind words have warmed my heart.

Secondly, I believe that while children are a gift, you also should not have more than you can handle.\n\nChrist Himself never had a child and He even said that blessed rather is the woman who follows the word of God over a woman who has given birth (Luke 11:27-28) That doesn't mean mothers aren't blessed, just that Christ does not care whether I have one child or zero children or ten children. I am the same in His eyes. \n\nAnd further, I am a woman, NOT a womb. I HAVE a womb, and I have the CHOICE to get pregnant or not, I don't HAVE to. I'm a thinking, feeling person and I matter, not just for my ability to get pregnant.

You may not ever know 100% whether it’s a sin or not, but do you think it could be good for your relationship with God to say, “Lord, I’m not sure on this, but I’ll give this up anyways if there’s even a chance it risks my relationship with you.” Things that aren’t layed out 100% word for word in God’s word take even more faith and trust, so giving up something you are unsure of could show even more love towards Jesus.\n\nThis doesn’t only apply to masturbation, it could relate to other questions of, “is \\_\\_\\_\\_ a sin?” Mainly about the things you think there is a chance you feel it is wrong, not utterly everything and anything you ever do in a spiral of overthinking / anxiety, so pray about things and stay rooted in the Bible at that point.

Anyways, hopefully this can help someone or be a good perspective, felt like I should share it.\n\nI do not mean to condemn anyone or say, “just stop and there you go.” repentance isn’t never messing up again but an active attempt to change direction towards God and away from sin, and go and sin no more, do not sin that grace may abound. Whatever anyone is struggling with, Jesus loves you still and don’t give up and lean on Him to get through it!\n\nI’m new to faith and have my struggles now even, but I feel like that could be a beneficial and loving thing to do, or a step to it at least. Overall, I think even if the Bible doesn’t literally and specifically say it word for word, Biblical principles would point to that it is a sin.

It may be emotionally heavy for some people.\n\nA few days ago, a typhoon hit my hometown and I was left without internet and electricity, so I didn’t receive any news about what was going on. Then, two days ago (I had only had power and internet back for a very short time), I saw people talking about the Epstein files on Instagram. I was confused but not interested, I thought it was nothing serious. Yesterday, however, I decided to look it up, and I deeply regret it.\nI used to be the kind of person who could watch heavy content without being too affected, and today I regret the things I watched and the way I thought back then. But the disgust I felt toward my past self does not compare to the disgust I felt while reading and seeing information about the Epstein files. I received an overwhelming amount of information all at once rituals, cannibalism, and other horrifying things.\nSome time ago, I had watched a video in which a man talked about how the devil is infiltrated in Hollywood and throughout the media. At the time, I thought he was partially right, but now I believe that at least 99% of what he said was true.\nI can no longer believe that any celebrity, famous person, or influential figure can truly be a good person.

It's supposed to feel impossible.\n\n​Jesus didn’t give that command from a comfortable pulpit; He gave it while living under Roman occupation. He knew what state violence looked like. He knew what it was to see a soldier abuse a civilian and get away with it.\n\n​But here's the hard truth we need today: Loving your enemy doesn't mean agreeing with them. It doesn't mean submitting to them. And it certainly doesn't mean letting them devour the vulnerable.\n\n​To pray for an oppressor, whether it’s a politician or an agent with a gun, is to pray for their repentance. It's to pray that God shatters the stone in their chest and replaces it with a heart of flesh.\n\n​We don't love our enemies because they deserve it. We love them because if we don't, we'll eventually become them. We love them to protect our own souls from being colonized by their hatred.\n\n​So, how do you do it?\n\nYou start small. You pray: \"Lord, stop them. Lord, bind their hands from doing evil. Lord, save them from the violence that's consuming them.\"\n\n​That's a prayer of love. And it's also a prayer of resistance.\n\nAfter you get off your knees, here's what you do:\n\n​1. Become an ICE watcher.\nThe State thrives on darkness. It relies, on good people looking away. Don't. When you see ICE or police detaining someone, you stop. You pull out your phone. You film. You stand at a safe distance, and you witness. You ask for badge numbers. You let the agents know: We see you. Surveillance is a two-way street.\n\n​2. Open Your Door (Literally).\nWe need to recover the ancient practice of Sanctuary. If you have a spare room, a basement, or a church hall, prepare it. The time is coming, and for some, it's already here, when \"loving your neighbour\" will mean hiding them. If your church isn't willing to be a hiding place, it’s just a social club.\n\n​3. Fund the Resistance.\nMoney is ammunition in this fight. Find the local bail fund. Find the GoFundMe for the family of those killed by ICE. Tithing isn't just for keeping the lights on in the sanctuary; it's for keeping the lights on in the community. Redirect your resources.\n\n​4. Disrupt the Narrative.\nEvery time you hear someone say \"illegal,\" correct them with \"human being.\" Every time someone says \"border security,\" ask them, \"At what cost?\" Don’t let the Empire's language settle comfortably in your home, your workplace, or your church. Be the awkward person who refuses to let the lie pass unchallenged.\n\n​5. Show Up.\nWhen the vigil happens for the man in Minneapolis, and it will, be there. Your physical presence is a vote. It says to the State: We're not afraid, and we're not scattered.\n\n​We pray to align our hearts with God. We act to align the world with His justice.\nNow, go.", "author": "TheFaithfulCitizen", "score": 143, "num_comments": 19, "created_utc": 1769301795.0, "permalink": "/r/Christianity/comments/1qm49xm/reflections_on_minneapolis/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qm49xm/reflections_on_minneapolis/"}, {"id": "1qgzuta", "subreddit": "Christianity", "title": "The Christian duty to resist authoritarian regimes", "selftext": "Pope Leo XIV points out that we are to follow our conscience.

You should not do the latter. \n\nAs a Christian, you’re called to forgive in your heart to release resentment and bitterness, as taught in the Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6:12-15), where we ask God to forgive us as we forgive others—this protects your own soul and relationship with Him, even without an apology from an offender. \n\nHowever, full reconciliation and restoring the relationship often requires the offender’s repentance, as Jesus outlines in Luke 17:3-4: rebuke them, and if they repent, forgive. In cases of serious harm like violence, it’s wise to maintain boundaries for safety (Matthew 18:15-17), and you aren’t biblically obligated to invite them back into your life until there’s genuine remorse and change. Pray daily for grace to let go internally, but if an apology comes, extend forgiveness generously (Matthew 18:21-22).\n\nYou might find Matthew 18:15-17 particularly useful if you are looking for a step-by-step guide on how to address this. \n\nIn short, your brother’s actions are not so much about you as they are about whatever he’s going through and projecting on you. Unfortunately, this led him to do hurtful things intentionally. It’s difficult to quantify things like this, but by shredding your bible, it is probably much more hateful to you than even if he punched you in the face. Your silence toward him afterward was a message that you were upset, and yet he did not apologize even after many months. If he does not acknowledge how his actions hurt you and take accountability for what he did, by letting him back in because of mistakenly thinking it’s the most Christian thing to do, you are actually indirectly signaling to him that what he did is okay and increasing the odds of him doing it again to you or someone else. You should not do this.   \n\nI’d follow Matthew 18:15-17’s advice: talk to him alone or with a group to convey how you feel, acknowledge what he may be feeling, and set your terms. While you already forgive him in your heart as a Christian, you need an apology from him to continue your relationship. \n\nGood luck.

There is a right way (or at least there used to be, not sure how many they're letting do it now) to gain citizenship, and people here without permission are violating the nation's laws.  Up to this point, if MAGA wants to make these claims, I have no objection.\n\nWhat I don't agree with, though, is everything else:\n\nFirst, ICE and its actions are undeniably unconstitutional.  1st amendment rights are being violated on our citizens (right to protest, freedom of speech).  2nd amendment rights were violated when Pretti was killed for the crime of \\[ostensibly\\] having a firearm.  They're toeing the line with 3rd amendment rights when political pressure is applied on businesses that don't give them quarter (restaurants, hotels, etc.).  They're categorically in violation of 4th amendment rights at multiple points, believing themselves above the law when it comes to warrants and the right to search.  And perhaps most egregious in my estimate, the 5th amendment violations - failure to provide due process to those they seize or assault, instead \"disappearing\" them off to weird prisons (or perhaps worse, foreign nations).\n\nI'm also guessing a case could be made that ICE is also a violation of Article 2, as a form of power that was not intended to be exercised by the presidency, but I'm in out of my depth there.  It would be interesting to hear a legal justification for their very existence from an originalist's standpoint.\n\nAs a Christian, I flat-out reject how ICE conducts themselves, as well as the current administration's perspective on how the sojourner (whether we're talking about illegal migrants, asylum seekers, or even naturalized immigrants and their descendants) is treated.\n\nFrom my point of view, this is a movement of white supremacy or xenophobia with a thin veneer of \"border security\" as a justification, though I realize that view doesn't hold true for everyone who supports ICE.  Also, I think a lot of this is a direct result of a certain senile old man having trouble distinguishing between \"insane asylum\" and \"asylum seeker\", as evidenced by some of the really weird stuff he says.", "author": "ridicalis", "score": 81, "created_utc": 1770032351.0}, {"id": "o35mem6", "post_id": "1qtpuoj", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "IMO, the 8th amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment is also being violated.\n\nFor example, there is now a measles outbreak in the TX Dilley Family Detention Center.", "author": "Parsimile", "score": 39, "created_utc": 1770040771.0}, {"id": "o35vlh7", "post_id": "1qtpuoj", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "So the  fact that Trump made 3 marriage vows in front of God and broke all 3 didn't give you pause?\n\nThe fact that he talked about grabbing women's genitals  didn't give you pause?\n\nThe fact that he bragged about going backstage while young women were changing at his beauty pageant  didn't give you pause?\n\nThe fact that he separated families and lost children didn't give you pause.\n\nThe fact that he withheld funds from Ukraine to try to force them to announce a sham investigation didn't give you pause?\n\nThe ways he mismanaged COVID didn't give you pause?\n\nThe way he fomented an insurrection on J6 didn't give you pause?\n\nThe fact he was found liable for digitally raping a woman  didn't give you pause?\n\nThe fact he was found guilty of falsifying business records to pay off a porn star didn't give you pause?\n\nThe blowing up of boats and of survivors didn't give you pause?\n\nThe violent way his administration has been targeting immigrants and citizens of color didn't give you pause?\n\nThe fact that this administration lies about the people ICE has shot didn't give you pause?\n\n\n\nAll of that didn't give you pause?\n\nMy sister in Christ  you have turned a p blind eye towards this man for 10 years.\n\nThere were primaries.

I told off my family (not my immediate family. My kids are not Trumpers and never have been) and told off my husband’s family… I said if you can’t be bothered to speak out about any of this, I don’t want to have anything to do with you.\n\nSince then, I’ve seen my normally reticent sister post a couple of things in support of ICE. So I guess I was right. I knew my other sister was already in that bucket, but she normally keeps quiet also now because I told her off after January 6.\n\nBut it has gotten bad enough that we have to say something and if you’re not gonna say something, then I know you’re willing to turn in Anne Frank. Law and order ya know.\n\nWe got a new pastor in July 2024. I really miss my old one. He was better about this stuff but as I haven’t talked to him since October 2023, I don’t know where he has come down on things lately. \n\nThe new guy I had hopes for. And I tried to start talking to him in October 2024 when I was expressing frustration with the lamb basting of entire populations of immigrants based on the perceived actions of a few(some of which were outright lies in the first place, like the eating cats and dogs thing). About the eating cats and dogs, he kind of laughed about that when I said it wasn’t true, he said “well, except when it is” ha ha ha, corny joke. He does tend to be very corny and sometimes his jokes are very lame. So I cut him a little slack there. \n\nBut I’ve talked to him at length every couple of months about things that would come up and every time, it got worse. When I brought up the fact that Christian Asylum seekers were being sent back to Iran, without being given their due process, I was horrified when he basically said that I was being sued by the left-wing propaganda. I was not getting this from the media, although they did play a clip. I got it from the pastor who made the recording and he’s not liberal. \n\nMy pastor is pretty sure there must be an easy get out the way to get from a closed Islamic country as a Christian into the United States legally… with all their papers intact I guess, so I guess in his mind they have to do it that way.\n\nThe privilege is astounding and unbecoming of a pastor who has to care for hurting souls. \n\nI haven’t been back since Renee was shot. We’re not far outside of the metro. I have to go in pretty frequently for medical appointments and I’m on edge every time because I never know where they’re gonna show up. They are prowling around our smaller communities as well. Our pastor was unaware of this until my husband went to talk to him shortly after the Good shooting. We support our local food shelf. Our food shelf gets staked out by feds all the time. So that regardless of immigration status or skin color, almost nobody wants to go and make use of the assistance. \n\nPeople who volunteer to deliver supplies to the fearful get followed. \n\nOur pastor just seems to want to remain in his world of books and study. He does talk about the need to love our neighbors, but I don’t think he understands what that actually means.\n\nHe asked me if I was OK when I didn’t come to church for a couple weeks, I said I don’t know what I can say that hasn’t already been said. He told me he doesn’t want the uphill in the world to be the source of division. I said it’s not the world it’s the church. And then I quoted from Ezekiel 33 about the watchmen who needs to fulfill his responsibility to warn the people of the approaching danger and then I blocked him.\n\nMy husband is on the same page, but he is more quiet, less direct (and I think in that way, it gives a lot more opportunity for misunderstanding, which is a frustration of mine). But he is an elder there. And he’s wrestling with that. When he talked to pastor about all of this, he basically got the same “you are being influenced by left-wing propaganda.“ My husband is one of the most objective, almost to a fault, people that I know. That’s at least the third time I’ve gotten that line from pastor. Twice to me and once to him. And the fact that he’s gonna dismiss my husband’s why are you complaining well thought out understanding of what is going on as some kind of brainwashing is just insulting. But he said it really nicely so I guess that’s OK in many people’s books. 🙄\n\nThere was a really good short video from a lady who uses a little bit of colorful language (warning) that really explains why we are in this position:\n\n[“…We are here because powerful men hurt children and will burn the entire country down before they let the truth come out… Why don’t you start asking why the government is bending every law possible twisting every narrative and arresting whoever the hell they want so that they can protect these monsters?”](https://www.facebook.com/share/r/14SN17A3nvW/?mibextid=wwXIfr)\n\nEXACTLY.

It was the state religion of Rome for a reason. It isn't a threat to Christianity, because this is how it's been for nearly 2000 years. It's a threat to Christ. But Christians can't seem to separate Christ from Christianity, and that's the real problem in my opinion. Christ is so much more than just an image of worship.\n\nPlease, put yourself into the shoes of a non-believer. *This* is how history remembers Christianity. This is the religion of \"love and peace\" that the genuinely good and well-meaning Christians have been telling us about for centuries. This isn't anything new. Not even going back to Rome's involvement, but just recent history. Slavery, segregation, women not having equal rights, LGBTQ+ people not having equal rights, a war on science and education, etc. This is what happens when radical Christianity gets into political power. History shows this repeated *over and over and over and over again.* Rome, Europe, the Americas. It always resembles Roman rule. Why is that? If there truly is a god with a \"divine plan,\" then shouldn't this plan be visible and recognizable by noticing patterns throughout history?\n\nAnd I truly don't mean this as an attack on Christ. But this is the religion that good and well-meaning Christians have presented to us. As an atheist, I truly believe in the importance of uniting the world in the *spirit* of Christ. I just wish more Christians could separate Christ from Christianity.

Does this not mean that I, as a religious outsider (or a \"Gentile\"), have \"come to Christ\"? The fact that *so many* non-believers come to these conclusions without god, the Bible, Christianity, or Christ should mean something to Christians.

It’s best to look at the framework of spirit forces and how they work. Although I graduated with honors from an Ivy League seminary (Theology major with Bible emphasis) nevertheless, it was not actually helpful to the Christ walk and dealing with the baseline of reality which are spiritual forces. \nOf course you know Ephesians 6:12 “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.”   But that is a generalized statement. It is the specifics that are not normally known. To zero in on the main spiritual battle zone, is best. \n\nThree points, *there are times that seem like valleys so we don’t feel the Sonlight. That’s because the walk of faith is a focus on Truth. Like a pilot flying in the dark through a storm, he has the truth instrument panel to present the reality of his total flying information package. Many pilots have decided to go with their feelings and have crashed. We live by the facts of Truth.   **When we see accurately the facts of spirit force realities, we see that the best choice in a storm at sea is to stay by the captains side at the wheel, not, to get out of the ship. ***Also there is the struggle of Paul in Romans 7 that points to how weary he was and actually had a crisis point that became a Segway to more truth about how these deviant spirit forces were fighting to drag him down. And it is this third point that the following outline addresses. \n\n  I. Here’s The Thing; One main force battle\n\nA. ., Not known or taught or recognized in many Christian groups (it doesn’t matter what denomination you are) is the fact of …the sin nature or flesh. Romans 7:17 and restated in verse 20 V 17 “in  that case, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.” V 20 “if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.” [ the same thing is repeated twice for importance]\n\nB..,,This sin nature is a real implant in the human body. It is the internal urge/impulse drive and voice influence sending thoughts and images to the mind. Everyone is influenced to some level. It is not the same as the devil, but the devil works with the sin nature to lead, urge and drive us deeper into wrong, because, it gains more power if it is successful.  The habits/addictions/disorders  are not the same for everyone but Satan and the sin nature tailor their efforts at the takeover approach to each individual.\n\nC…You notice he even says, “ there is this thing/force in me, but it’s not the real me. The real me is my connection with Christ Who helps me want to do good.” \n\nD. We know that all strength and goodness is going to come through the work of Christ on the cross AND His resurrection life that lives in us. \n\n      ..1. His cross work. (We know that Christ died for our sins and we are forgiven) But His work on the cross also made provision to stop the activities of the flesh/sin 1 Peter 2:24  He himself bore our “sins” and “sin nature” (ἁμαρτία, Greek word: see Winer’s Grammar) in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness.\n         *** His cross work dealt with the sin nature so it has no rights of control. [BUT WE NEED TO DEPEND ON CHRIST TO APPLY HIS WORK]\n          ***Scripture calls this application “ being crucified with Christ”. Galatians 2:20\n\n   ….2. When we count on His Work, and use His Name as our power source, that plugs us in; even if that sin nature, squawks and pretends it has power, and tries to control us.\n\nII  Summary seen in key verses Galatians 5 \n\nA. Key verses V. 24. “Those  who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sin nature/ flesh with its passions and desires.\nV. 25 “Since we live by the Spirit, let us walk in step with the Spirit…”. \n\n   …. 1. Notice this phrase in v 25. “Live by the Spirit” Also . Ref Ephesians 1:13 “sealed by the Spirit.” \n……..2. Notice =“walk in step with the Spirit “ =this is the same instruction as other verses; walk in the Spirit; be filled with the Spirit; be clothed with Christ; abide in the vine, etc.\n\nB. Don’t be discouraged when all is not perfect; it is called “ growing in grace strength “ 2 Peter 3:18\n(Note that Grace, is often confused with the word mercy. Grace, most often, means; energy, ability, power from God) \n\nC. Remember; the key cornerstone of the sin nature’s work is to get us to depend on ourselves; in fact, it is the automatic default mode that we wake up in every day. But the more we can ask help and depend , the more grace strength we have.   All blessings to you 🙏🏻🙏🏻 1 Thessalonians 5:17 “Pray in the Spirit at all times, with every kind of prayer and petition.”\n\nD. To repeat the truth about depending on Christ; this process of looking away from ourselves to Christ is vital. We cannot look within ourselves for strength anymore than we can look within ourselves to produce forgiveness of sins. \nColossians 2:6 \n“Therefore, just as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him”.  \n…. We did not receive Christ by looking within our own ability. Also, this vital truth is stated another way by Jesus in John 15:5 “ ……. apart from Me, you can do nothing……”.  This truth is forged in depth of understanding through failure. God is not far from us in our failures; we are transitioning in our understanding and learning. \n\nExtra :-)   1 Peter 5:8. “Be alert.  our adversary the Devil (with his tool the flesh/sin nature.) is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for anyone he can devour” Devour means to take over one’s life and use us for Satan’s energy tool, like we use food for energy to do things we want .\n\n2 Corinthians 2:11 “so that no [advantage] would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.”     (Most people are ignorant) But the word advantage in Greek is “pleonektéō”.  defraud”) shows inordinate desire, especially lusting for what belongs to someone else. (You belong to Christ) To abuse  from Strongs Greek; used of “a greedy, covetous, ……… rapacious, (reference to rape a  person.) a defrauder, to take over.\n\nBut we are not ignorant; we have the cross of Christ and the Life of Christ present with His leading, power and Truth 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻….", "author": "Material_Research199", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1771162970.0}, {"id": "o5ia14k", "post_id": "1r4zdkx", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": ">The only way to beat lust is to flee from it.

It's in our wiring because it has to be for our species and many others to keep reproducing and populating the planet. The desire to have sex isn't an evil moreso than it is for any other animal to want to do so like your dog, your cat or your bunny.\n\nYes, it's an issue if it affects your life or other people in a negative way. If you cheat, that's bad too.\n\nWe also have to look at society as a whole. We are bombarded with sex all the time. It's in our media, video games, movies, books, advertisements, etc. We have things like makeup, photoshop, filters, implants, skimpy clothing, etc. It's a lot of imagery thrown at our reptile brains that didn't grow up with it.\n\nThe solution is to understand that obsessing over sex isn't great, but that there are reasons why people do so and that society is also a part of it. We have to forgive ourselves and to know we can still be good people that want to do good. It's not to make people feel bad and terrible because they were infatuated a time or two.\n\nWe just have to accept that society will throw it at us and we just need to not focus on it and focus on doing what's right, being educated and helping others. The black and white mentality is more likely to trap people in the cycle of lust because they feel like just because they watched porn that they are incredibly dirty people who are failures. Porn addiction is not ideal, but people can get out of it and still live functional lives and be a good person.

In fact, to a Baptist church of all places. But I made a deal with God: any doubt I had, I would face head-on. No sweeping it under the rug. So far it's gone well for me. I have, as many Christians claim, a personal relationship with Jesus. That relationship, more than Scripture, guides my life. It's like being a little kid and having an NFL linebacker as your best friend. But I read plenty of Scripture. Every day. I research it. Compare it. Pray about it.

God calls this good, and while sounds strange, in practice I agree. \n\nWhile I am not a calvinist, it is scriptural that God ordains everything to its own purpose, as He is sovreign. This includes those who He knows will be reconciliated with Christ, and those who will die.\n\nBut how you see this comes entirely down to pride and humility. God is the main actor upon the universe. Our only significance is what significance He gives us.\n\nIn sin we are described as walking dead. Here today, gone tomorrow. Humanity's sin as founded by Adam and Eve was to sepperate from God as our source of life, provision and wisdom. And thus, sepperation from God is to become foolish and die, as we no longer partake in the source of life.\n\nAs Abel and Cain demonstrates, sin is evil, and thus God has judged it to perish. But returning to God allows us to love and be loved by God in deeds.\n\nGod still loves His creation. He gave us Jesus Christ to reconcile us, anyone who asks of Him with sincerity. This allows us to be forgiven, so we can prove our faith to God and return to Him.\n\nBut this rarely happends without incentive. Such as suffering, or by hearing the good news. So in this way, suffering becomes a force of good. Wickedness has no value, and will pass away either today or tomorrow.

He is God, not an impersonal force, as clearly stated in Acts 5:3–4: \"But Peter said, 'Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to ***lie to the Holy Spirit*** and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not ***lied to man but to God***.' (ESV, emphasis added)\n\n>If 3 of them consider as God's why do Christians believe in 1 are the separate or the same.\n\nSee reply to first part. This is a mystery. But let us consider what \"one\" means. In the Hebrew Old Testament, the word which describes God as \"one\" is Hebrew *echad* (אֶחָד). This same word is used in Genesis 2:24 (\"For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall become *one* flesh.\") Now, I am married, and we are \"one\" flesh biblically speaking, but we are not the same person - nor even the same body but are now one. This is a mystery. We are joined, united, even in our physical body, yet are two persons.\n\nGod is united in His essence yet is three persons. We don't *understand* this, but we do receive this according to Scripture: that there is one God (Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 44:6, 1 Timothy 2:5), that the Father is God, the Son is God (John 1:1, most famously, as a sample), and the Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:4, as above), and that the Father is not the Son nor Holy Spirit, nor are the Son the Holy Spirit each other (Jesus refers to the Spirit as \"another\" in John 14:16, and says the Father will send Him, and calls the Father His own).\n\nIf God does not change (Malachi 3:6, James 1:17), then He *is* Father. He did not *become* Father, but Father is His very being. That which defines a father is a relationship to one he has begotten. Ergo, the Father is *eternally* Father to a begotten Other.\n\nThis Other is likewise *eternal* and, being begotten from the Father, has the Father's attributes (just as my daughter has my hair color and eyes, for example): He is eternal, all-powerful, all-loving, et cetera. What defines this begotten one is His relationship to the Father, namely that He is begotten, and one who is begotten of the Father is either a son or daughter; we know because the God the Son is begotten of a singular Father, the only option is a masculinity (Sonship). Also, Jesus Himself is a human being, a man, male, thus *Son*.\n\nThe Holy Spirit, then, proceeds from this relationship. If you look to the Eastern Orthodox, they will say the Spirit proceeds only from the Father (though perhaps *through* the Son), whereas Western/Latin Christianity (Roman Catholicism and \"Protestantism\", broadly speaking) will say the Spirit proceeds from the Father *and* the Son. I will let those who care about the *filioque* controversy fight about it. What matters is that there is this relationship between Father and Son, and this relationship is an eternal third Thing, a love, a bond, and in this love and bond a shared will which is manifested not in an esoteric power, but in a *person*, as identified in Scripture.\n\nWhat God does, He does as Trinity.

Any attempt to explain the Trinity is going to fall short somewhere, and I like that you admitted it’s not perfect. That kind of honesty goes a long way in discussions like this.\n\nI think the reason it resonated with me is that it helps resolve some of the tension people feel when they first encounter the doctrine. But where it needs a little tightening is in how Scripture actually uses the language.\n\nIn the Bible, “Son of God” doesn’t mean something that comes out of God because it is God. In Jewish usage, “son of” usually speaks of relationship and shared nature. When Jesus called God His Father, the Jews understood that He was making Himself equal with God. So the phrase points to distinction and shared divine nature, not something flowing out from a single Person.\n\nAlso, Scripture never speaks of “the Father of God” in that way. The Father is God. The Son is God. The Spirit is God. But none of them are described as coming from God as if God were a separate source behind them. The Father sends the Son. The Son prays to the Father. The Spirit is sent. There’s real distinction there, not just different expressions of one Person.\n\nSo while your wording helps push back against the idea of three separate gods, it can start to sound like everything is just flowing out of one Person, which isn’t quite how Scripture frames it.\n\nStill, I genuinely appreciate the way you were thinking through it.

A lot of times, these kinds of questions stem from a misunderstanding about the Trinity that are rooted in pagan concepts of deity. Pagan gods are instances, in contrast the Trinity is a substance. When I was in college, I had a friend that was into philosophy, and he and I were trying to explain substance to a third friend. It was not a conversation about the Trinity, but the informal definition that he gave that day was one I've found very helpful. It's a really informal definition, and it kinda falls apart when you press on it at all, but it really helps some people start to reshape their thinking. He said that substance is that to which number does not properly apply.\n\nSeveral analogies are helpful. Each analogy works on a different part of the problem. I'm going to give a few analogies, and each one will be set to build on the one before it. They will each supply part of the picture and each approach understanding from a slightly different direction. This way, hopefully, you'll be able to triangulate your understanding and see where there is overlap between the analogies and where they separate, and by triangulating on that overlap you'll get a deeper understanding.\n\nThink of cheese. If I tell you \"I have three cheeses,\" I mean that in an entirely different way than when I say \"I have three trucks.\" A truck is an instance. A cheese is a substance. \n\nWith that analogy set, the Trinity isn't a physical substance. The Trinity is a metaphysical substance. Like number or Gravity. In previous generations, this part gave a lot of people problems, but we've entered an age where the vast majority of people interact with metaphysical objects and substances fairly regularly. For example, an app. Again, I don't know you, so I don't know what apps you do and don't have on your phone, but for the sake of the example I'm going to pretend that you have the Reddit app on your phone. If you don't, pretend along with me, please. I'm also pretending some other background details, don't be that guy that makes me spell them all out.\n\nI also have the Reddit app on my phone. The app that I have on my phone and the app that you have on your phone are the same app. And yet, if I delete the app, it does not impact the app on your phone at all. That's what it means to be an instance of a substance. There are also things that we know about Reddit on your phone because they're the substance of Reddit. For example, it shows conversations between people. That's just what Reddit is. It's the substance of Reddit. \n\nAnd with that we're ready for the third analogy: a book. One of my hobbies is that I'm an author. For each book that I write, I have the manuscript on the cloud, a paperback edition, and an eBook. Which one is my book? All of them. If you take a paperback copy of my book and throw it in the fire, you really have burned my book. But you didn't burn the substance of my book, you burned an instance of it. My paperback copy on my desk is unaffected by your pyrotechnics. When I take my books to fairs and such, I usually take two instances of each. When I have two books sitting on the table with the title \"Meeting the Gardener,\" that only represents one book that I've written. It's the same book when it's an eBook.\n\nThat brings us to trying to understand what the substance of God is. This is best addressed by 1 John 4:8, 16 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love... And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. \n\nSo now on to your questions. \n\n1. Is Jesus God or the Son of God.\n\nBoth, in the same way that you're a human and the son of a human. \n\n2. Who is the Holy Spirit?\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Love that Christ and the Father send forward.\n\n3. If all three are God, then how can there be only one God?\n\nBecause they are one in substance. \n\nI have an \"elevator pitch\" which sums this up.\n\nLove is self-sacrifice: the giving of yourself in such a way as to benefit the object of your love. (John 15:13) Love exists, and makes choices, and has power; for God is Love. (1 John 4:8, 1 Corinthians 13) Love made us to Love us, exhibit itself, and for us to Love it. (Romans 11:36) Love cannot be without the choice to choose otherwise, and that choice can only be real if there are some who actually chose otherwise. (Proverbs 16:1-2, 1 Corinthians 10:13, Deuteronomy 30:19, Proverbs 12:15, Proverbs 16:25) In order to be fully the same thing as Love, Jesus Christ entered the world (John 1:1, John 1:14, John 1:17, Matthew 1:20) in a process we call the incarnation, and fully gave himself to us to die a humiliating death at the hands of and on behalf of those who had chosen otherwise. (John 11:50-51, Matthew 26:2) Christ sent his Love forward to join with those who chose to be an expression of Love in the world. (John 14:26, John 15:26, John 16:7) We have the choice to be an expression of the Love that sent Christ, of Christ, of the Love Christ sends, and to express our love through study, through emulation, (Romans 6:6, 1 Corinthians 1:23, 1 Christians 2:2, 2 Corinthians 13:4, Galatians 3:1, Galatians 5:24, Galatians 6:14) and through obedience. (1 Peter 1:22, Hebrews 5:9, 2 Thessalonians, John 13:34, 1 John 2:7-8, 2 John 1:5) God's Righteousness (1 John 3:10, Hebrews 1:9, 2 Thessalonians 2:10) and God's Mercy (2 John 1:3) both flow from God's self, which is God's Love in Truth. As such, we should seek to enact justice and mercy in our own life as an expression of love and truth. (1 Kings 10:9, 2 Chronicles 9:8, Psalm 33:5, Ephesians 2:4, Jude 1:21) What do you choose?\n\nI hope that helps.", "author": "ShaunCKennedy", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1769409854.0}, {"id": "o1s0chu", "post_id": "1qn6dwl", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "God is one in Being and three in Person— one in Being and three in Person. Now, that is not a contradiction. See, if I said He's one in Being and three in Being, that's a contradiction, and I'm arguing with myself. If I say He's one in Person and three in Person, that's a contradiction. But, instead of that, God is one in Being and three in Person. So, the next obvious question is, 'What's the difference between a Being and a Person?' I'm glad you asked.\n\nA Being is that quality that makes you what you are, or makes a thing what it is. So, Being is what-ness, and a Person is that which makes you who you are. Thus, if you ask me “what” am  I? I must respond with “I am a Human Being”. That is the what I am. For example, I am a human Being;  But, if you ask me “Who” am I. It does not make sense to respond to that question by me saying, “I am a Human Being”, since you had asked me WHO am I, not what am I. Who I am is not a human Being;  But rather, Who I am is actually Simon Williams. What I am includes heart, lungs, muscles, eyes—it's all this: tendons, bones, etc. That's what I am. That's not who I am. Who I am is a kind, loving, caring, compassionate Person, as my wife would tell you immediately. Who deals with personhood role, not the what of the person.\n\nWho I am is very different from what I am. Humans happen to be one Being and one Person. That's what humans are: one Being, one Person. God is different. God is one Being-Divine Being—Yahweh is what we call God—but He's three Persons: Father, Son, and Spirit. Those three Persons are equal because they're all God; they've all existed from the beginning, like John chapter one says, because they're all God.\n\nSo, then the question comes up, 'Well, how can Jesus say something like the Father is greater than I if they're all God?' And the answer is actually quite simple. Let's say I pointed to the President of the United States; let's say I said Obama. I can very accurately say Obama is greater than I am because when he goes somewhere, he rolls with a posse. He's the most powerful man in the world; there are news conferences when he sneezes. I mean, he's greater than I am. But is he any more human than I am? No, he's not. He's greater than me in terms of role, but he's not greater than me in terms of essence.\n\nIn the same way, the Father is greater than the Son in terms of role. The Father is superior; the Son is subjected to the Father in terms of role. And we see that in 1 Corinthians 15; it says that Jesus is going to subject Himself to the authority of the Father so the Father can be all in all. It's because the Father is superior in terms of role, but is He any more God than Jesus is? No, because they're both DivineBeing(God), and There's only one God, and they're equal in essence Being: Father, Son, and Spirit.", "author": "mariavasquez111", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1769410973.0}, {"id": "o1s1k3u", "post_id": "1qn6dwl", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "Perhaps a more psychology based explanation will help you somewhat understand.

I find it interesting that he says that Jesus is not just for the “left” or for the “right”(which is true) yet cannot just give a sentence expressing disapproval of the ICE’s actions. I found this disappointing.\n\nAs someone who still struggles with people-pleasing to some extent, I get it. He may not want “rock the boat” or alienate a significant part of his followers. But the Bible tells us: “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them”(1 John 2:15). The word for “world” comes from the Greek “kosmos” meaning “organized civilization”(biblehub.com, “1 John 2:15”). Since the Fall, society has been structured in a way to oppose God’s will. Misuse of power and prejudice are not new, but the ICE is certainly an example of an organization that is perpetrating this. This is not just about Jelly Roll or me. But believers are told to believe the good news(Mark 1:14-15) and proclaim the Kingdom of God(Luke 9:60). \n\nJesus died for our sins once for all(1 Peter 3:18). That includes Jelly Roll, his supporters,me, and everyone else. But if we claim to follow Jesus, we have to mirror what he did. \n\nThere’s a famous sermon Jesus made in the synagogue in which He says, “…He(Yahweh) is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the LORD’s(Yahweh’s) favor”(Luke 4:18-19). Jesus will return to establish a rulership and restoration of society(Acts 3:20-21; Ephesians 1:8-10). A society where there will then be a new heavens and a new earth where there will be no more crying among God’s people because the old, broken world order has passed away. \n\nI do not claim to be “good”.

We definitely have a responsibility to care for the marginalized and ignoring suffering is completely incompatible with the faith.\n\nHowever I think you are missing the mark on what the actual core of Christianity is. When you define the message as love everybody with no exceptions you are essentially turning the Gospel into a new law.

The main message of Jesus was not a new social commandment but the Gospel that He came to give His life as a ransom for many.\n\nJesus met sinners with grace but He also called for repentance. He did not just say I love you He also said go and sin no more. Biblical repentance is not just about changing how we treat people but recognizing our sin before a holy God and turning to Him.

The reality is that we all fall short whether religious or outcast and we need salvation by faith because our own ability to love will never be enough.\n\nHave you considered that focusing on the Gospel instead of the Law actually gives us a better reason to love others since we realize we are all equally in need of grace?", "author": "RandomRandomio", "score": 16, "created_utc": 1769782532.0}, {"id": "o2mgsne", "post_id": "1qr526f", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "200% true and very well and compassionately said.

What you’re describing isn’t rebellion, laziness, or failure... it’s a human crisis, and you’re not weak for going through it.\n\nFirst, let me say this plainly: questioning God does not mean you’ve lost Him. In the Bible, doubt is everywhere.\nDavid says: “Why, Lord, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?” (Psalm 10:1)\nJob cries out to God.\nElijah collapses and asks to die.\nEven Jesus, on the cross, says: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46)\n\nSo if your faith feels empty right now, you are not abnormal, and you are not alone.\n\nNow let’s separate a few things, because they’ve been tangled together — and that’s part of the pain.\n\nGod is not the Church.\nGod is not priests.\nGod is not religious politics.\n\nJesus Himself constantly challenged religious authorities. He said:\n“You load people with burdens hard to bear, but you yourselves do not lift a finger to help them.” (Luke 11:46)\n\nSo if being around priests drains you right now, that doesn’t mean Jesus is false. It may mean your soul is exhausted by religion, not by God.\n\nYou said you just want to be “human”. That matters — because Christianity doesn’t erase humanity. It starts there.\n\nJesus didn’t come preaching ideology. He ate, wept, got tired, felt abandoned, and sat with people who were broken.\nHe says: “Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)\n\nAbout your failure — I’ll be very direct and very kind: your exam did not define your worth.\nIn Scripture, God consistently chooses people who “failed” by society’s standards — shepherds, fishermen, outsiders, the overlooked.\n\nPaul writes: “My power is made perfect in weakness.” (2 Corinthians 12:9)\n\nNow the big question: is Jesus even real? Does God exist?\n\nHistorically, yes. Jesus of Nazareth is one of the most well-attested figures in ancient history, mentioned not only in the Bible but by non-Christian sources like Tacitus and Josephus.\n\nPhilosophically, if the universe began (and science agrees it did), something outside time, matter, and space must have caused it. An effect requires a cause. Belief in God is not irrational.\n\nBut Christianity is not primarily a theory to be proven. It’s a relationship to be encountered.\n\nThe disciples didn’t follow Jesus because they understood everything. They followed because they met Him — and something changed.\n\nRight now, you’re not drowning because God disappeared. You’re drowning because your identity was built on performance, approval, and certainty — and all three collapsed at once.\n\nAnd God is not afraid of that collapse.\n\nIf I can offer one simple step — not a sermon, not a ritual — it’s this: speak to God honestly, even angrily, without religious language. Just truth. The Psalms are full of raw prayers like that.\n\nYou are not broken beyond repair.\nYou are not less human for doubting.\nYou are not abandoned.\n\nJesus is real and He is closest to you right now, not farthest.\n\nYou don’t need to have answers today. You just need to breathe and take one honest step at a time.\n\nYou’re not a burden. You’re a person. And your life still matters.\n\nGod bless you abundantly 🤍✝️", "author": "AdParty3355", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1770546226.0}, {"id": "o47uyqt", "post_id": "1qz2e08", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "I understand your distress.

What’s remarkable is that history records Alexander the Great (4th century BC) fulfilling this when he conquered Tyre by literally throwing the ruins of the old city into the sea to build a causeway to reach the island fortress. Alexander himself is also foretold in Daniel 8:5–8, 21, symbolized as the swift goat from the west. These aren’t myths, they’re historical facts.\n\nNow here’s the part that makes you pause: Why did the Lord Jesus Christ arrive roughly 300–400 years after Alexander the Great, not before?\nAlexander conquered a vast empire stretching toward India. His campaigns unified regions under Greek (Koine Greek) as the common language, improved and connected roads, and accelerated trade and movement across the known world. Later, the Romans expanded and stabilized this infrastructure. The result? When the time came, the New Testament was written in Greek, and the apostles could travel efficiently and preach the Gospel across nations.\n\nIt makes me ask: Did God use Alexander the Great, without him knowing it, to prepare the world logistically and linguistically for the spread of His Word?\n\nAnother historical point that really makes you stop and think is Cyrus the Great of Persia.\n\nLong before he was born, Isaiah explicitly named him as God’s chosen instrument:\nIsaiah 44:28,  “Who says of Cyrus, ‘He is My shepherd, and he shall fulfill all My purpose,’”\nIsaiah 45:1–4, God even says He will go before Cyrus, open gates, and subdue nations for His sake.\n\nHistorically, Cyrus conquered Babylon in 539 BC by diverting the Euphrates River, lowering the water level so his army could enter the city through the river gates at night. This isn’t Bible legend, it’s recorded by ancient historians like Herodotus and confirmed by archaeological sources (including the Cyrus Cylinder). Babylon’s defenses were considered impenetrable, yet it fell exactly as described.\n\nAfter this conquest, Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Israelites to return to their land and rebuild the Temple, fulfilling Jeremiah 29:10 and recorded in Ezra 1:1–4. What’s striking is that Cyrus wasn’t an Israelite, he was a pagan king, yet God openly says He raised him up for this purpose.\n\nWhen you step back and connect the dots, Cyrus restoring Israel, Alexander the Great unifying language and roads, Rome stabilizing infrastructure, it raises a serious question: Is history really random? Or has God been moving nations, kings, rivers, and empires to prepare the world for His plan, ultimately fulfilled through the Lord Jesus Christ?\n\nYou don’t have to accept this as proof.

I had reached the top of the hill, and the tractor stalled. It shut down, and the electronic handbrake didn’t come on. I started rolling backwards, rapidly, towards another person in a car. They managed to swerve out of the way and saw everything, so described it to me, as I was knocked out in what followed up. \n\nThe trailer jackknifed and the tractor drove over the drawbar. It snapped and the tractor rolled over. Twice. Two full flips, down a hill, with me inside, tools being thrown around everywhere, windows broken. I didn’t have my seatbelt on, because farmers rarely wear seatbelts for some stupid reason in a tractor. On the second flip, the roof was torn off and I was thrown out, gripping the sunroof, unconscious. By the end of it all, the tractor was in shreds down the hill, everything completely torn apart, and the tractor had finished the rollover, standing upright. It should have definitely killed me. I did not break a single bone. Only one medium deep cut. My head was untouched. I believe that it was God who saved me from that, because my survival rate for something like that was incredibly low, let alone not to break one single bone. ", "author": "Ill_Mix279", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1769116945.0}, {"id": "o18l6fk", "post_id": "1qi2yr6", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "His sheep know his voice and he recognizes theirs.", "author": "ThinkDeeper16", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1769176494.0}, {"id": "o19s34g", "post_id": "1qi2yr6", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "I had a dream of a car spinning out of control just a few nights ago.   Glad to hear Jesus saved you.", "author": "RepairResponsible899", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1769188668.0}, {"id": "o1ailmf", "post_id": "1qi2yr6", "subreddit": "Christianity", "body": "Jesus is so good!
