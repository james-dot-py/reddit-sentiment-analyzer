I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity. This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.\n\nI know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.\n\nThank you for all that you do.  \nTim",

        "selftext": "Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told employees that he’s “deeply distraught” with the US’s current approach to immigration and will continue pressing the issue with lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve heard from some of you that don’t feel comfortable leaving your homes,” Cook said during an all-hands meeting with staff on Thursday. “No one should feel this way. No one.”\n\nThe CEO added that immigration is especially important to Apple, which has “team members across the US on some form of Visa.”\n\n“For as long as I can remember, we have been a smarter, wiser, more innovative company because we’ve attracted the best and brightest from all corners of the world,” he said. “I am going to continue to lobby lawmakers on this issue. You have my word on that.”\n\nThe remarks expanded on a memo that Cook released last week, when he said he was “heartbroken” by events in Minneapolis, where US immigration agents have killed two people in recent weeks.\n\n“This is a time for deescalation,” Cook said at the time. He also said he had discussed the matter with President Donald Trump.\n\n“Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,” the CEO during Thursday’s meeting. “No matter where they come from.”\n\nAfter Cook’s initial memo was released, employees privately criticized Cook for his limited and late response to the shootings. The executive also responded to an employee who said during the meeting that they are concerned about being deported and separated from their daughter.\n\nCook said, “I love you if you’re on DACA,” referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that allows people who came to the US as a child to remain in the country on a work permit. He said that Apple has hundreds of DACA workers. “I will personally advocate for you,” he said. “I am a huge believer in the program.”\n\nDuring the meeting, Cook also discussed the company’s artificial intelligence efforts and teased upcoming devices running the new technology.",

        "selftext": ">In November 2024, an anonymous listener of the Relay FM tech podcast \"Upgrade\" claimed that Apple was [developing 90Hz display technology](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/apple-working-on-90hz-studio-display-imac-ipad-air/) that could be used for the next Studio Display, as well as future iPad Air and iMac models. This higher refresh rate would make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye, but 90Hz would stop short of the 120Hz refresh rate that iPhone, iPad, and Mac models with ProMotion support can achieve.\n\n>Now, a *MacRumors* tipster has backed up that claim, based on alleged information from an internal build of iOS 26 that was leaked online. Indeed, they believe the next Studio Display is likely to max out at 90Hz rather than 120Hz.\n\n>Apple's existing devices typically have up to 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rates, so 90Hz would be unusual for Apple. However, while there is no explicit confirmation, the tipster claimed that multiple code strings and display controller references in the internal iOS 26 suggest that the next Studio Display will max out at 90Hz.",

There is no option to hide all hidden advertisements. \n\nThat means that a software that Apple provides with their premium devices includes **functions** that **guide** users towards a **subscription**. They do not contain any functionality in the software that is used. \n\nI believe that it's important to let Apple know our opinion. Something like this can quickly escalate further. Imagine veiled Ads in Settings, Finder, Notes or Safari that push the user towards other subscriptions and decrease the usability of the tools.\n\n  \nLink to send Apple feedback: [https://www.apple.com/feedback/](https://www.apple.com/feedback/)\n\nDetails and screenshots can be found under the following link: [iWork 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1qyguq0/i_feel_like_people_are_downplaying_the_creator/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\nI work in IT support and know many people that are not tech affine, especially elder people. They are quickly overwhelmed by veiled advertisements like these. So they subscribe, sometimes even unknowingly to things they don't need and pay for it - monthly or weekly. I know that this update will cause many people to subscribe to something they don't need and/or to have problems with the software that was hitherto really good to use. \n\nAs a UX-designer I also know how malicious these buttons are. They **only** serve to guide people towards a company goal. They **decrease** the **usability** while increasing the feeling of missing something. Of course that itself is not a problem but I find it very concerning that something like this appears on software that is included with premium devices which have a price that should cover the cost of basic software.\n\n  \nNote that I'm not against Apple Creator Studio itself. I like that Apple provides improved software for their basic Apps, even if I preferred a one-time buy option. \n\nHowever it is my strong belief that they should only advertise in setup, the App Store and maybe in one place that does not interfere with the daily activity in an App.\n\nLooking forward on your opinions on the matter.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSince it’s the time of the year where many of us are thinking about picking up healthier habits, I thought I’d share some major updates to **FitBee**, a calorie and macronutrient tracker I've been building solo over the past year and a half.\n\nThe most rewarding part of this journey hasn't been the code, but hearing from users and having real-world impact. Someone recently reached out to let me know they’ve lost 30lbs using FitBee so far. They mentioned that because the app is fast and bloat-free, it was the first time they actually stuck with tracking. Hearing that is exactly why I started this project—to build a tool that gets out of your way so you can hit your goals.\n\n# 🚀 Major updates since last time\n\n* 💦 Water Tracking: You can set water goals and track them using the app or the interactive widget. I didn’t actually track my water before building this, but now that I do I’m pretty shocked at how often I don’t drink enough water.\n* 👟 Step Tracking: You can now set step goals and track them in the app.\n* ❤️ Apple Health import/export is free for everyone - I want FitBee to work well with other apps and I don’t want to “lock” people in - they should be able to take their data with them.\n* 🥘 Improved food database - this is a never ending process, but I’ve added tons of foods to the database since last time.\n* ⚖️ Better support for logging by grams - Many FitBee users log their foods with a scale, and I’ve made that simpler by adding features like letting you set the cooked weight of a recipe.\n* 🛒 One Time Purchase Option - Many people requested the ability to do a one time purchase, so that is now available.\n* ✂️Robust Shortcuts Support - Use Shortcuts to log foods, weights, water and much more.\n* 📱 Updated for iOS 26 - Full UI refresh to make it feel at home on Apple's latest OS.\n* 🌎 Localization - FitBee now supports nutrition label formats from US, UK, EU, AU & NZ.\n* 🐛 Many, many bug fixes and other improvements based on the feedback from users.\n\n# Why FitBee is different:\n\n* **Fast, lightweight and to the point** \\- The app is just about tracking your nutrition and makes that front and center. I've tried to make things that you do often as simple as possible (e.g., log yesterday's breakfast).\n* **Free barcode scanning** \\- Not much to say here except that it's free and works great!\n* **Photo Logging** \\- You can take a photo of a food and get an estimate of the calories and macros. It's not 100% accurate but it's been super helpful for me when eating at a restaurant that doesn't have published nutrition info.\n* **Accurate nutrition data** \\- The nutrition data is sourced from the USDA dataset and nutrition labels off the packages. I also spent effort adding east asian foods (e.g. things you get at 99 Ranch or Weee) to the database, since those were hard to find/track in other apps I've tried.\n* **Recipe importing** \\- You can pretty much point any recipe at the app and it'll import the ingredients and generate nutrition information for you. As I got more into fitness, I started to cook more so this has been super helpful.\n* **Robust Apple Health support** \\- You can sync data with Apple Health. I wear an Apple Watch so it's great for getting the energy burned through exercises.\n* **No Ads** \\- No ads, ever. See Pricing below on how development is supported.\n* **Premium Features** \\- FitBee offers a subset of features behind a monthly subscription. These include setting advanced nutrition goals, unlimited photo logging and unlimited recipe imports by URL.\n\n# 💰 Pricing\n\nFitBee is free for basic tracking, including barcode and nutrition label scanning and no ads. To take advantage of the premium features, you can sign up for a monthly or annual subscription. There's also a one time purchase option available (which a surprisingly many of you have used!.)\n\n**App Store Link**: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbee-calorie-macro-counter/id6443979108](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbee-calorie-macro-counter/id6443979108)\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback! I’ll be in the comments to answer questions and take feature requests.\n\n# 🌎 Availability\n\nFitBee is available in the US, CA, UK, AU, NZ currently. The main reason being that I don't have local food data yet outside of those countries. I'm hoping to expand access to more countries in 2026.\n\n# ❤️ A special thanks to this subreddit\n\nAs a special thanks to all the support and feedback I've gotten from this community, I'm giving away 10 lifetime, family sharing enabled subs. Just drop a comment below and I'll do a random drawing at the end of the week.",

Apple hopped on Camo when it was still in beta, encouraged us to go all in, had thousands of staff run it internally, nominated it for an innovation award, and made all sorts of promises about how they’d help.\n\n>Yet once we’d proven it could be done and users loved it, they took it and built our features into a billion iPhones, Macs, displays, iPads and TVs, while shutting us out and preventing additional interop we could provide to the ecosystem. I found myself at WWDC ’22 seeing our technology demoed, now as Apple’s “Continuity Camera,” by members of a team who’d previously been in my dms telling me they used Camo every day at work.",

I’m not talking about anything fancy just cutting and pasting a few things from one to the other lo and behold, what I pasted from the older document into the new one was lost! Also, there seems to be no easy way to bring up to instances of the Pages app on my iPad. They have “improved“ the multitasking experience after spending literally four hours this morning and getting multiple suggestions from mostly AI on outdated ways to use split view, I am no further than I was.

        "selftext": "Hello r/apple \n\n[App Link](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1620755771). Exclusive Promo Sunday discount is applied. \n\nThese started as Scriptable widgets that kept popping up on Reddit, calendar grids, year-progress trackers, countdown walls. People loved them. So we integrated them into the app with a proper/simpler UI for customization, and wired everything through Shortcuts so they update automatically.\n\n[Example 1](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/fluence-media/Example1.png), [Example 2](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/fluence-media/Example2.png)\n\n**What's available (all free, all ad-free):**\n\nOn device:\n\n**Calendar** — A dot-grid monthly calendar. Configure how many months show, columns, styling. Widget-safe padding so it doesn't get covered.\n\n**Year View** — A full-year grid where each day fills in as it passes. Shows days remaining at the bottom. Surprisingly motivating (or terrifying, depending on your outlook).\n\n**Countdown** — Pick a date, get a visual countdown that fills daily. Optionally renders over a random wallpaper from the library.\n\nServer side: these are premium locked.\n\n**Daily Random** — Fetches a new wallpaper every day (or hour). Set it and forget it.\n\n**Category Random** — Same as above but filtered to categories you pick.\n\nEverything except the two \"random\" modules runs **100% on-device**. No server calls, no tracking. The random ones obviously need to fetch images, but they're clearly marked.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nYou configure the wallpaper in-app, then add it to a Shortcuts automation (there's a one-tap import). Set your schedule, every morning, every hour, whatever. The wallpaper updates automatically.\n\n**I've got a few ideas for where to take this next, but I'd genuinely love to hear what you'd find useful and build it out with the community.**\n\nWeather or conditions overlays?\n\nFocus mode-aware wallpapers?\n\nHabit/streak trackers?\n\nSomething else entirely?\n\n*P.S. The Shortcuts on-device features are 100% free. no pop up ads, but if you want there's a discount for Promo Sunday today. And if you catch any bugs let me know.*\n\n[App Link](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1620755771)",

So I built SuperAge — same data, actually useful.\n\n**Your biological age** — mine came out 4 years younger. Almost high-fived myself.\n\n**Metrics that help you decide** — Body Energy, Readiness, Endurance, Stress. So you know when to push and when to chill.\n\n**Deep workout & sleep analysis** — heart rate zones, aerobic vs anaerobic, sleep quality, and how it all impacts your age over time.\n\n**AI coaching** — personalized tips powered by Apple Intelligence, entirely on-device.\n\n**Full Apple Watch support** — complications, glances, everything.\n\nComing soon: **blood test analysis** to compare your \"real\" biological age with what wearables estimate.\n\nNo accounts, no cloud, no creepy stuff. Free to use — optional Pro ($29.99/year) for deeper insights.\n\n**Update 02/02/2026**\n\nSome comments here have gotten pretty toxic, so I’m going to step back from replying. If anyone has genuine questions or feedback, my DMs are open, happy to chat there.",

Some features, such as links and link previews, are unavailable.\n\n**Web browsing**: Certain complex web technologies are blocked, which might cause some websites to load more slowly or not operate correctly. In addition, web fonts might not be displayed, and images might be replaced with a missing image icon.\n\n**FaceTime**: Incoming FaceTime calls are blocked unless you have previously called that person or contact within the past 30 days. Features such as SharePlay and Live Photos are unavailable.\n\n**Apple services**: Incoming invitations for Apple services, such as invitations to manage a home in the Home app, are blocked unless you have previously invited that person. Focus and any related status will not work as expected. Game Center is also disabled.\n\n**Photos**: When you share photos, location information is excluded. Shared albums are removed from the Photos app, and new Shared Album invitations are blocked. You can still view these shared albums on other devices that don’t have Lockdown Mode enabled.\n\n**Device connections**: To connect your iPhone or iPad to an accessory or another computer, the device needs to be unlocked. To connect your Mac laptop with Apple silicon to an accessory, your Mac needs to be unlocked and you need to provide explicit approval.\n\n**Wireless connectivity**: Your device won't automatically join non-secure Wi-Fi networks and will disconnect from a non-secure Wi-Fi network when you turn on Lockdown Mode. 2G and 3G cellular support is turned off for iPhone and iPad.\nConfiguration profiles: Configuration profiles can’t be installed, and the device can’t be enrolled in Mobile Device Management or device supervision while in Lockdown Mode.\n\nPhone calls and plain text messages continue to work while Lockdown Mode is turned on, although incoming calls won't ring on a paired Apple Watch. Emergency features, such as SOS emergency calls, are not affected.",

Lockdown mode is meant for people who believe they are high level state or military targets. \n\nThere are software exploits called Zero Days. Since iOS is so complicated there will always be exploits in the system. There are companies like NSO Group that specialize in finding these exploits. For example they could find an exploit in how iOS processes gifs and use that to hack into a phone. They sell that as a product named Pegasus.\n\nFinding these exploits is extremely expensive and mostly bought by state intelligence. It’s for high profile targets. Recent examples are President Macron and Jeff Bezos being targeted. But an authoritarian regime could also use it to spy on journalists if they are seen as enough of a threat. \n\nRemember this a cat and mouse situation between these companies and Apple/Google/Microsoft security. So once an exploit is used it’s probably junk. It’s too expensive for regular people to be concerned with. For all intents and purposes the FBI or any other law enforcement cannot get into a modern iOS device unless the person is a massive military target. \n\nIf I did a shit job at explaining look up Pegasus. There are credible documentaries you can find. The one on how the the French President was targeted is fascinating.",

For the first time, users can use Precision Finding on Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, to find their AirTag, bringing a powerful experience to the wrist.\n\nWith its updated internal design, the new AirTag is 50 percent louder than the previous generation, enabling users to hear their AirTag from up to 2x farther than before.”",

He is referring to Apple's Wearable, Home, and Accessories category, which saw around a 2% drop in revenue year-over-year.\n\n>AirPods Pro 3 no longer have any extended delivery delays on Apple's online store, so it would appear that Apple has caught up on supply by now.\n\n>AirPods Pro 3 feature increased active noise cancellation, improved sound quality, longer battery life per charge, heart rate monitoring during workouts, improved fit for many users, increased water resistance, a new XXS ear tip size, and more.",

Walmart thinks it is different than all other retailers… and they hope to mine all that transaction data for profit. \n\nBehind the scenes, the dynamics are different in other ways. The EU (not sure if the UK still abides) caps credit card fees to merchants at 0.3% and debt card fees at 0.2%. In the US, merchants are charged 2.5-3.0% … ten times as much. The EU bans credit card fees at purchase (for EU bank cards) while US merchants are now commonly charging a 3% credit card fee. And US cards have crazy benefits programs which are largely absent from the European cards because US cards charge so much to merchants. \n\nI’d much prefer the EU system. But people in the US traveling for work - where they charge their personal card and are reimbursed by work - love all the perks on US cards. Same with small business owners, who get a “free” fancy vacation for the family every year while avoiding all taxes on the points “perks” which are really costs paid by their business. \n\nMy only point being - things seem odd on the surface, but underlying issues explain the differences and there are pros and cons to both systems. Even Walmart - they derive value from mining your data which is reflected in their extremely competitive prices. They may be the Ryan Air of retailing, but Ryan Air is the largest airline in Europe for a reason. ",

        "body": "My problem isn’t even about Apple Pay specifically — it’s that Walmart still refuses to support basic tap‑to‑pay. Their chip readers get so clogged with dirt that I have to press down on the opposite side of my card just to make sure the chip makes contact. Tap‑to‑pay would avoid all of that.\n\nAnd on top of it, Walmart stores your full card number. That’s how they can recognize your card and automatically text you a receipt when you enter your phone number. It’s an unnecessary security risk, and eventually the card networks are going to get tired of it and start pushing back on processing their transactions.",

They’d let Jony Ive run wild with the design and take it in directions that weren’t ideal for user experience or accessibility. They then spent the next few major versions reigning in the excesses of the UI and optimising the crap out of it. By the time iOS 11/12 rolled around we had a stable, mature UI that worked well on all supported phones and was happily accepted by the vast majority of iPhone owners. \n\nYou can absolutely expect the same for Liquid Glass. The next versions will improve system performance*,  tone down the transparency and animations a little and improve baseline readability. \n\n*Somewhat. They still want to use it to encourage people on older phones to update.",

This will likely be especially useful when astronauts are conducting an experiment or looking outside a window and see an interesting, transient phenomenon.\n\n>However, Isaacman said the decision to allow astronauts to bring iPhones is about more than just capturing cool new photos and videos. It’s part of his effort to challenge long-standing NASA rules and requirements.\n\n>“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” he wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface. This is a small step in the right direction.”\n\n>The challenge of qualifying modern technology for spaceflight is real. There are a million ways in which the technology can become mired in the approval process, from radiation characterization of chips to battery thermal and vacuum tests, outgassing concerns, vibe testing, and other qualification concerns. Yes, these requirements exist for a reason. But Isaacman is now telling his team to challenge requirements to ensure they are still needed today. (If you don’t believe this is important, ask any NASA contractor about bloated requirements.)\n\n>Smartphones have flown to orbit before. For example, two iPhone 4s flew on board the final space shuttle mission in 2011, though it’s not clear whether the crew ever touched them. For the most part, though, astronauts living on board the International Space Station over the last decade have used tablets to connect to the Internet and communicate with family members.\n\n>Astronauts flying on private missions, including Isaacman’s Polaris flight and the Axiom missions to the space station, did bring smartphones.",

This results in collisions with the transistors, memory cells, and sensors, causing random errors. The smaller and denser the features, the more likely an error will occur. Noise reduction may handle the images, but it will be interesting to see how well the software runs on devices that haven't been space-quantified.",

        "body": ">According to Apple's release notes, iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 include unspecified bug fixes and security updates, but there are a couple features that Apple didn't highlight.\n\n>The updates add a tool for transitioning from an Apple device to an Android device. Transfers are able to be started during the device setup process, and moving data from one device to another can be done without having to download apps from Apple and Google.\n\n>The transfer process supports moving photos, messages, notes, apps, passwords, phone numbers, and more, and it's not too surprising that Apple isn't advertising it. Data transfers were already possible, though not quite as simple, and Apple likely doesn't want to encourage users to move to a different platform.\n\n>In December, the European Union took credit for the new transfer tool, touting it as an example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers. Google and Apple apparently implemented the feature because the DMA requires services to offer interoperability to prevent customers from being locked in to an operating system. The two companies opted to add the functionality worldwide rather than just in the EU.\n\n>iOS 26.3 includes a setting to limit carrier location tracking, though it is limited to a few select carriers worldwide. In the United States, only Boost Mobile is supporting the feature as of now. EE and BT in the UK offer it, as does Telekom in Germany and AIS and True in Thailand. It is a feature available only for devices with C1 or C1X modems.\n\n>In the iOS 26.3 beta, Apple added other Europe-only changes for third-party wearables, which were shared by the European Commission. Devices like headphones and smartwatches will be able to use some of the same functionality available to the AirPods and the Apple Watch going forward.",

        "body": "wow sorry about the split comment - the new ios literally crashed my reddit app as i was trying to upload 🙃. here is one example of an alarm i use. if you want to integrate music into your alarm you have to rely, unfortunately, on access to apple music as it will not integrate spotify or youtube music. it isn’t particularly challenging to build, based on one’s background in tech you could have more of a learning curve but over you’ll need to fiddle with it. once you’ve got it down, it functions flawlessly. it doesn’t require an on ringer but that volume has to be high enough to make a noise in the morning. you can even make one set to run automatically to have your volume up to x %. or turn all your focus settings off 20 minutes after you wake up. many options.\n\ni have a ton of different alarms for situations, like a quiet one when i first aake and then they have progressively louder music, and this was has a chill music (acoustic covers of songs) AND announces the time so i hear what time it is. i expanded one of the “blocks” in the screenshot so you can see a setting for the audio announcement. i would be more than happy to share more details or examples but thought i’d include this simple one for you now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13rtkvrbpxig1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=003869d4fe79ce031d6fd1c55acd928f62abe155",

From what we know, it's literally deleting the old Siri that has been iterated on for years, and adding in the new one, new FreeForm features, credit card saving features in third party apps, health app features, and those are just the ones we know about.\n\nI'm assuming most are heads down on iOS 26.4 + the broader app intents framework to make sure the new in-app actions with Siri works across the device+first party apps. \n\nThat being said, I really do believe iOS 27 will be much better from a bugs perespective. From what I can tell, Bloomberg previously reported that they will be taking a year off from major features (outside of the AI features planned that were also reported by Bloomberg) to cut old code, debloat the syste, and make efficiency gains wherever possible. It feels like since iOS 17, they've just added feature on features and it's a mess. Case in point is the lockscreen/homescreen editing. It always felt so janky since launch, and despite being 3 major versions with those changes, from what I can tell the bugs have worsened.",

And the worst part and how I know this shits software related: it’s perfectly random, zero predictability when it happens and when it does, it forces me to restart. Don’t have this issue with any of my other Apple devices which concludes me to believe this is iOS based and it’s been happening since one of the later ios18 updates too as this didn’t happen when I got my iPhone.",

These included a $1bn acquisition of Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019, a $600mn acquisition of Dialog Semiconductor in 2018 and a $500mn acquisition of Israeli flash memory firm Anobit in 2011.\n\n>Other more recent deals have reflected the iPhone maker’s focus on computer vision and artificial intelligence, following the launch of the Vision Pro headset and ‘Apple IIntelligence’, its suite of AI features. These include last year’s acquisitions of Israeli 3D avatar start-up TrueMeeting and generative AI company Pointable.\n\n>Q.AI was founded by Aviad Maizels, Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya in Tel Aviv in 2022. It has been operating largely in secret ever since, with Wexler hinting in a social media post soon after it launched: “I can’t tell you anything yet about our product — but I bet it will leave you speechless.”\n\n>Its financial backers also include Kleiner Perkins, Spark Capital and Exor.\n\n>Some of Q.AI’s team previously worked on another Israeli start-up, PrimeSense, that Apple acquired in 2013. PrimeSense’s 3D sensing technology formed a key part of the iPhone’s FaceID login system.",

They’re take their time with new technologies, ignore hype and stay on a sound, solid path instead of one built from speculation. That’s why Apple stands to benefit from a correction. What will make AI great is what they’ve been working on for years: on-device ML and chips designed for power efficiency above all. What will make AI profitable is selling people the hardware to run features based on private hardware access to your data, not offering a free chatbot that tries to manipulate you as a form of advertisement.",

But for finding subtle bugs in complex codebases and applying acceptable fixes? Not at all. \n\nI offload virtually all my unit testing to AI. I offload some simple tasks to AI. I offload a lot of debugging around why I’m getting an error to AI. \n\nBut AI cannot replace an actual dev in a real, enterprise level system. And I have serious doubts it will ever be able to.",

The underlying theory doesn't change and I know good SWEs will find that their work and their understanding of how to architect good software will accelerate.  I have been thrilled with the things I can do with AI as a helper, and have finished several side projects and hobby programs this past couple years that otherwise I didn't have the energy after a full workday to really engage with as much.",

Just the other day she decided that apparently it was time to randomly stop communicating with multiple lights in the house, which of course meant they all needed to turn on at the same time in the middle of the for some really good reason.\n\nPlease Apple, for the love of God, stop focusing on putting out new hardware at a breakneck pace and strengthen your  essentials before you dive into a real go at smart home stuff. The experience CAN be so good, it used to be and it can be again, but current gen Siri aint the sauce. I don't have regrets about converting everything over, when it works it still works, but Siri is the absolute Achilles heel of the whole setup.",

These interfaces are barely maintained now, essentially as loss-leaders, simply to prevent against the backlash of removing support entirely. I'm shocked to learn that Apple is building a hub. Maybe it'll solve the problems with Smart Home accessories.",

With things like music players, phones, watches, etc., they weren’t exactly early to market and usually launched with a limited feature set but they were able to pare down the market to essential features and do it well.  Smart home is somewhere this is lacking in the market, and I’d probably feel better about trusting Apple to my home security than other companies.  Maybe it’s also something like the Airport or other accessory lines where the each product doesn’t necessarily need to be successful on its own, but provides competition that forces third parties to keep up or at least ensures that consumers have options that match their latest device capabilities.",

I’m sure it was helped along by Jobs himself, but, I’m also sure the teams themselves had this culture. \n\nOver time, though, as the teams have grown in size, and the dictatorial Jobs isn’t there to force people to his will (he was notoriously difficult to work for because of his finicky-ness), the culture has shifted. People with “microsoft culture” and “google culture” are now in the mix of people making decisions and shipping products, and the end result is where we currently are. \n\nAmongst the UI “slip-ups” that I read about was that the anchor point for window resizing does not hug the window contour, and instead is now “outside” the window region since the window border is curved. By Apple standards, this absolutely should be an issue to be rectified. But, I noticed the other day at my work Windows computer, that’s exactly also the behavior on Windows 11!! And no one cares, no one has commented, people just adjust and move on. \n\nWe’re getting to the era of the least common denominator, and someone at Apple needs to get the culture right if they are to correct themselves.",

The ones that I notice usually relate to large volumes of data or files, and I usually end up with someone at AppleCare or occasionally an \"engineer\" admitting that \"it just wasn't designed or tested for that much data.\" And I'm talking about everything from a spreadsheet in Numbers behaving unpredictably after getting past 1000 rows (since resolved, thankfully) to the Mail app choking altogether when the size of a mailbox exceeds system ram (not really resolved but I no longer have any machines with less than 24gb ram), search tools breaking, Siri behaving unpredictably around a large contacts library, etc. I'm always in the ignored 20% on this stuff, so I just get to see the bugs persist version after version. And usually, people on Reddit tell me that I'm wrong for noticing or caring because \"it works fine for me.\"",

A much younger staff who does not even use the OS, software, or devices they design for, or haven’t used them for long enough to know about, understand, and *internalize* the design patterns, intended user experience, and history of the platform. Responsibility seems to also be much more split up within the corporations, with extremely varied competence between them, and nobody is allowed to touch components ”outside” of their direct scope without going through a ridiculous amount of middle management, processes, design leads, etc for even the most basic of changes.",

        "body": ">Apple released macOS Tahoe last September, but despite two point updates since then, it is still struggling to resolve an embarrassing interface issue in Finder that appears to have been introduced with its Liquid Glass redesign.\n\n>If you updated your Mac to macOS Tahoe and you prefer to work in Finder's column view, there's a good chance you've been frustrated by the glitch, which developer Jeff Johnson has been admirably tracking over on his blog.\n\n>At the bottom of each Finder column are handy little resize handles allowing you to expand or reduce each column as you see fit. But in macOS 26 and macOS 26.2, when scroll bars are set to \"always show,\" the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom overlaps and covers those handles, so you can't click them to adjust column widths the way you could in earlier macOS versions like Sequoia.\nfinder\n\n>With the recent release of macOS 26.3, however, Apple attempted a fix. The vertical scrollers were shortened so the resizing widgets now sit above the horizontal bar and are technically clickable again. Unfortunately though, as Johnson points out, the horizontal scroll bar still overlaps file names in the view, causing it to regularly obscure content. Moreover, if you hide the path bar and status bar, the layout leaves a weird amount of empty space below the scrollers, making the whole thing look unfinished (see image below).\n\n>Johnson's take is basically that while the most disruptive bug is less bad now, the overall column view layout still feels half-baked – especially for anyone who keeps scroll bars always visible.\n\n>As Daring Fireball's John Gruber points out, it's an embarrassing fudge for a company that used to pride itself on pixel-perfect settings across its Mac operating system.",

Because without ample white space and relatively static content or data driving it, you end up with overlapping objects.\n\nAnd while even _that_ can be made to look nifty for design concepts, in reality things like even basic mouse hit detection and readability fall apart when you’re actually trying to _interact_ with and _use_ it.\n\nEmphasis on the _use_.

Highly softened geometry, large radii, and low-contrast layering visually signal safety, friendliness, and touch-first interaction.  \n\nHowever, when applied to a precision productivity environment, the design implies play rather than control, so the emotional tone conflicts with the cognitive task.  In other words, the design failed *semiotically*: the visual cues communicate casual while the software is used for high-attention,  information-dense work (e.g., Final Cut Pro), which conveys a loss of rigor and trust.\n\nThe same thing is happing on iPadOS where the touch menu is now hybrid, the first touch pulls up the traditional horizontal pill menu but tapping the arrow brings up a second desktop vertical menu which is perceived as hostile in context of a touch-screen interface.\n\nThis is why Apple always ignored the call to put macOS on iPad hardware or a touch screen on macOS.  As they slowly abandon this stance, they simultaneous undermine iPadOS and macOS and begin their walk down the same path of failure that pushed Microsoft out of the handheld market.",

They went into detail on this at the News launch presentation but of course it's been quickly forgotten.\n\nApple's privacy focus is legit, they go out of their way to preserve privacy in many situations their tech peers would give zero fucks about.  \n\nUnfortunately this means they absolutely suck at ad targeting but they still want to make some ad revenue so they sell their poorly targeted ad spots to whoever is interested in poorly targeted ad spots which is apparently mostly scammers.",

Different divisions have different key results and incentives to perform, which are sometimes at odds with the objectives of the wider company, but are isolated enough that management doesn't take notice. \n\nThe app store is the same. It focused purely on revenue as drivers. This effectively gave up a fantastic position to be one of the biggest gaming platforms in the world in order to chase cheaper money via games that have microtransactions / gacha mechanics. Short term this has a huge payout. Long term it creates a scenario where the user doesn't trust the market. In business it's *very* easy to sell trust for a profit, but you can't buy it back. This was a failure of Apple's upper management to keep their brand safe.",

The whole project is insanely expensive and disruptive, and I think we're all able to see that the practical applications are nowhere near as widespread or useful as the Altmans of the world have claimed. \n\nIn the industry I work in, there is one company that has gone all-in on AI, but they started out that way, so they have really good procedures for using GPT to make content for them. The trick? *Everything that the model makes needs to be checked by humans and tweaked before going live.* GPT makes huge amounts of language that they need, then they feed that to another GPT to look for the big problems and cull/fix the problems, then to another to flag ones that definitely need followup, and eventually, someone looks at literally everything to make sure it's okay before it starts getting served to clients.\n\nFor what they do, this still represents a massive reduction in effort and expense, and they can have a relatively small number of content area experts as opposed to an army of mediocre content checkers, and can afford to pay those experts enough to keep them. Also, since they have been doing it since GPT2, they already have procedures in place, and improvements to the models means that the amount of checking/fixing work goes down over time.\n\nBut it still needs to be done for literally everything.\n\nIn their case, they are literally producing language, the one and only thing LLMs really excel at. For just about any other business, the outputs from these things are such a mess that I suspect that the \"checking\" step is as hard as the \"writing\" step would have been otherwise.\n\nAt some point, investors are going to get sick of being fleeced, the model companies are going to have to try raising prices to something that has some hope of at least breaking even, customers will dwindle, the companies will crash, and they will take down so many others with it.\n\nIt's insane that we've let it go on this far.

Possibly even for the 19 too (the contracts, not manufacturing). So yeah, I wouldn't expect this to start to hit Apple until at least the 19, possibly the 20\n\nPlus the fact they have big margins helps a ton. Apple can afford to absorb a short term price crunch on hardware to maintain their pricing and general market position, as long as it doesn't become prolonged or double the overall cost price - and we aren't at that point yet\n\nObviously they couldn't sustain it forever, but if it lasts a year or two then between existing contracts and their profit margins, I wouldn't expect Apple to increase prices for a couple of years. If we get to 3-5 years then yeah, they're gonna start making price adjustments",

I am pissed about alt app stores. \n\nI was promised sideloading thinking I’d get to install all the emulators like Dolphin on my phone without sideloadly. But what I got is this:\n\n-Fortnite came back to iOS and even App Store but EU users MUST use Epic Games app store which is barebones and has nothing except fortntie\n\n-Delta emulator which is best emulator UX wise was released on app store worldwide but EU users must install Altstore PAL first which is even worse since it has TWO APPS only. Oh and as a nice bonus before Epic Games funded Altstore, users must pay 0.50 euro fee to the developer. So a free app for everyone became a paid app all because reasons…\n\n-Apps are still locked with Apple approval bureaucracy making alt stores pointless and bloatware’ish. I can’t use JIT for example.\n\nIn a nutshell my experience became worse compared to “locked” Americans and my only freedom here is a privilege to install bloatware in order to download apps I want to download because devs are salty at apple but not salty enough to not release their apps on App store in other regions.",

        "body": "Regardless of a store, Apple still acts as a gatekeeper. Even if a developer wants to publish to an alt store, he still needs to go through the process like for the official one: legally register with Apple (requires a national ID for private persons), pay an annual subscription fee of 100€/$, and submit apps to Apple for notarisations (otherwise they can't be installed on devices even if they are distributed via an alt stores).\n\nOnce the developer has gone through all that, they can publish either on the App Store or the Alt Store. Why, after all efforts and hurdles, should a developer select the Alt Store with a much, MUCH, smaller audience? Why the end user shall install AltStores if developers prefer official store? Of course, the official App Store looks waaaaay more attractive/easier with a bigger audience once a lot of money and effort have already been spent.\n\nDevs will not select the official stores only when their apps have some VERY specific requirements that won't pass Apple's review, like emulators. This raises quite uncomfortable questions though. If emulators aren't allowed in the official store due to some security concerns, but can be installed through alt stores, then Apple is okay if user devices can be compromised? Then, if they are okay that devices could be compromised through alt stores, then why do they act as a gatekeeper asking for an annual fee and require notarisation? If their system is good enough and alt store apps can't compromise devices, then why emulators aren’t allowed in the App Store? Something doesn't match in their rhetoric.\n\nNeedless to say, in this uneven situation, it's hard to open and maintain an Apple-approved store, which also requires going through all Apple's processes. This effectively zeroes out all efforts as Apple has done everything to protect its profits.\n\nAll that kills the whole idea of alt stores. If Apple were to remove all these obstacles, I strongly believe the situation would be totally different, and Apple knows it and it doesn't like it.\n\nAlso, Apple can't sell me the \"privacy and security\" narratives as my company's MacBook contains a lot more confidential and sensitive information, but I or company still can install apps directly from developers. Does this mean that macOS is less secure than iOS and can't be used for work?",

        "body": "Saved you a click: \n\n1. UWB 2 - The ‌AirTag‌ 2 adopts Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip.\n\n2. Longer Range - UWB upgrades mean that Precision Finding works from 1.5x further away than before. Precision Finding is the feature that allows an ‌AirTag‌ to be precisely located in a close-range indoor area. It is able to lead you directly to the ‌AirTag‌ with a compatible device.\n\n3. Precision Finding on Watch - Precision Finding was previously limited to the iPhone, but it now works on the Apple Watch Series 9 and later and Apple Watch Ultra 2 and later, as these devices have UWB chips.\n\n4. Louder Speaker - The ‌AirTag‌ 2's speaker is up to 50 percent louder than the speaker in the original ‌AirTag‌. The upgrade will make it easier to hear when playing a sound, plus it is an additional anti-stalking measure because it will be more difficult for sound to be masked.\n\n5. Better Bluetooth - Apple is using a newer Bluetooth specification with increased range.\n\n6. New Internal Design - To accommodate the updated speaker, Apple revamped the internals. Rumors suggested Apple would make it harder to tamper with the ‌AirTag‌ to remove the speaker, but we'll need to wait for a teardown for confirmation.\n\n7. Updated Weight - The ‌AirTag‌ 2 weighs 0.42 ounces or 11.8 grams. it is seven percent heavier than the original ‌AirTag‌.\n\n8. Revamped Text - The text on the back of the ‌AirTag‌ is now all in capital letters, which is a good way to determine whether an ‌AirTag‌ is the first-generation model or the new model. The text also now lists IP67 water and dust resistance, plus it mentions NFC and Find My support. These features aren't new, but aren't listed on the back of the original ‌AirTag‌.\n\n9. Still Not For Pets - Apple's ‌AirTag‌ 2 announcement and product page specifically state that the device is for tracking objects, and not people or pets. Despite this, many people use AirTags for tracking their animals.\n\n10. Reset Process - To reset an ‌AirTag‌ 2, you need to remove the battery, leave it out for at least five seconds, and then insert the battery again. The process has to be repeated four times. Apple says that it can take up to 12 seconds to hear the final tone. With the first ‌AirTag‌, there was no need to wait after removing the battery before reinserting it.\n\n11. Requires iOS 26.2.1 - If you want to use an ‌AirTag‌ 2, you're going to have to update your device to iOS 26.2.1. The ‌AirTag‌ 2 requires the latest Apple software, which means it won't work with devices that aren't able to run iOS 26.",

        "body": "“TSMC has been the exclusive supplier of Apple's systems-on-a-chip since 2014, but that 12-year streak could be nearing its end.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Apple is exploring whether some of its lower-end processors could be manufactured by a company other than TSMC.\n\n\"Now that TSMC is doing more business with Nvidia and other AI companies, people with knowledge of the chip supply chain said Apple was exploring whether some lower-end processors could be made by someone other than TSMC,\" the report said.\n\nThe report did not mention any candidates, but previous rumors have indicated that Intel could begin supplying some lower-end Apple processors in 2027 or 2028.\n\nA few months ago, GF Securities analyst Jeff Pu said that he expected Intel to reach a chip supply deal with Apple for at least some non-pro iPhone models starting in 2028. Based on that timeframe, Intel could supply Apple with at least a portion of A21 or A22 chips for future iPhone models, if the companies agree to a partnership.\n\nApple's return to Intel might also involve some Mac and iPad chips. Last year, Tianfeng Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expected Intel to begin shipping Apple's lowest-end M-series chip for select Mac and iPad models as early as mid-2027. For this, Kuo said Apple planned to utilize Intel's 18A process. He did not mention the iPhone.\n\nThere is no indication that Intel would play a role in designing the iPhone chips, with its involvement expected to be strictly limited to fabrication. That would differ from the era of Intel Macs, which used Intel-designed processors with x86 architecture. Apple began transitioning away from Intel processors in Macs in 2020.\n\nIntel would help Apple diversify its supply chain, which could come at a pivotal time, as Nvidia has reportedly surpassed Apple as TSMC's largest customer amid rising competition for NAND memory and RAM chip supply for AI servers.\n\nTSMC is not the only chip supplier seeing increased demand amid the AI server boom, as Samsung and SK Hynix have both gained enough leverage to demand Apple pay more for RAM chips, according to The Wall Street Journal's supply chain sources.\n\nOn an earnings call last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that rising memory chip prices had a \"minimal impact\" on Apple's gross margin last quarter, but he does expect a \"bit more of an impact\" on the company's gross margin in the current quarter. He said Apple \"will look at a range of options to deal with that\" as necessary.\n\nApple reported record-breaking revenue of $143.8 billion last quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and it is predicting similar 13% to 16% year-over-year growth and gross margin of 48% to 49% in the current quarter, so the company is still reporting impressive earnings results despite concerns surrounding memory chip prices.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect price increases for the iPhone 18 lineup.”",

So I'm sitting here wondering what I'm missing, but the latest news is starting to make sense of it: it might just be naked price manipulation, now that we are seeing the \"side effects\" of this \"demand\" driving up chip prices for consumers and for every corporate customer that actually has money to pay for them. It's certainly possible that the eventual paper losses from giving away chips to companies without business models will be more than offset by price per unit hikes to all of the actual paying customers. And who is that? Us of course. \n\nIt seems like the end game of the AI scam is just what we should have expected from the start, plain old fashioned price hikes.",

The SE2020 is not even remotely close to being a priority for Apple, so I don’t think it’ll ever be usable again. In fact, I upgraded to iPhone 17 soon after updating my SE2020 to iOS 26 because of how unusable it became and I needed a working phone for travel at the time. I’ve updated the SE2020 to 26.3, still unusable, navigating the Settings takes nearly a second for each selection.",

The student pricing of $4/month or $39/year is bonkers.\n\nI will take this opportunity to raise awareness that Apple Motion is an incredible app for motion graphics and compositing. No, it’s not AE, but it’s extremely capable, as demonstrated in this video, “[Stuff you can do with Apple Motion – a retrospective](https://youtu.be/1xckKys1rWU),” by the Motion master Simon Ubsdell.\n\nAnother Motion master, Dylan Bates, has [a great course for Motion as well](https://fcbplugins.com/b/motionmasterclass) (not affiliated).\n\nFor me, professionally, I’ve switched from AE to Motion for shape- and text-based motion graphics and I haven’t looked back. The plugin integration with FCP is so much better and faster than Premiere/AE’s MOGRT ecosystem (I’m NOT talking about dynamic link here), **and** you can do very complicated things without any scripts/expressions, making it very friendly for those without a programming background (like myself).",

Not just the typing, reading in general is worse, Safari browsing is worse, app icons look terrible, quick settings are badly designed, and the Mail app UI is a mess. The whole system feels slower and stutters, which is unacceptable on a device that used to run smoothly.\n\nEverything is harder to look at and harder to use. Visual clarity and usability have clearly been sacrificed for some pointless “liquid” design experiment that actively makes the phone worse. It’s not an upgrade, it’s a downgrade in every sense, and I genuinely regret installing it.\n\nAnd on top of that, basic features are gone. I can’t even quick search for a contact in recent calls anymore. How does Apple manage to remove useful functionality while also making performance worse?\n\nWho approved this? Did anyone actually test this with real users? Because it feels rushed, careless, and completely disconnected from how people actually use their phones. If this is the direction Apple is going, I’m done. I’ll seriously consider switching to Android, because this is not the quality anyone should accept from Apple.",

I’d be in line for every major apple release and each device or major update felt like taking a step into the future. \n\nNow, I haven’t upgraded my phone in years. I avoid every new OS on mac and iphone like the plague. The last piece of hardware I was genuinely excited for was…. Apple watch ultra? Maybe? And not even that excited i just liked the idea of a better battery and more outdoresy features. \n\nIt’s a weird state of limbo. I dont want to switch. All my devices are jn the apple ecosystem but at the same time theres absolutely nothing good about it other than convenience at this point. \n\nHow far we’ve fallen huh. \n\nMaybe it is time to switch and once this phone finally craps out which I’m sure the new update will help with, I’ll start looking elsewhere.",

        "body": "I think it's partly because a lot of car companies are realizing the amount of money they can make if they offer subscription services (looking at you GM and Rivian) and are trying to move it all in house to capture a lot of those dollars. If they let you use carplay ultra, they'll never realize that money. Also, original car play offered something that the car companies didn't really have at the time. Carplay ultra doesn't seem to have that same level of upgrade from just a regular car with carplay. Also, android doesn't really have a similar offering, so they're still having to design the entire cars HUD/interface/UI anyway.",

        "body": "Aston actually did Carplay Ultra with a bunch of physical controls in their cars, but as I understand it Carplay Ultra doesn’t necessarily require nor prohibit any physical controls. Apple does require a quality touchscreen for Carplay Ultra but vast majority of cars these days will have a touchscreen, cars are even required to have a screen because of NHTSA rules that they require a backup camera and screen to show the camera’s view on.\n\nSeeing the Aston in reviews I think they did a good job of having controls plus a well integrated screen. But alas, many car companies will cheap out on controls and just have the touchscreen, but that is obviously happening without Carplay Ultra, or Carplay in general, just look at Rivian or Tesla who have no Carplay whatsoever, they are all touchscreen-only.",

I tried to type ‘into’ (with the word turn before it) and what I got was “j to” which autocorrected to “jnto” with a red line under which I then clicked and it suggest “into” which was my ORIGINAL FUCKJNG INPUT. And no that typo just now was not intentional. I don’t even know if it’s more funny or sad that it happened  but that’s how fucking bad this keyboard and autocorrect logic shit has gotten. \n\nI remember in the later stages of iOS 16 or 17 I would be able to type on silent without looking at the screen at a very high level of precision even in a moving vehicle. This meaning autocorrect would be able to use both my input and the context of what is being typed to write my intended sentences at let’s say an 85% success rate. So basically doing it blindly without any help besides autocorrect. \n\nNow I’d be happy with a 2-3% error rate than like the current 5%. But that’s with you laying down in bed with both hands typing. It’s absolutely ridiculous how bad it’s gotten and I might honestly step away from iPhones if Apple continues to ignore these issues that have been around for 4-5 months.",

        "body": "> Siri will reportedly have a new design\n\nRumours have it that it's going to be a face. The wild thing is that the \"glowing edges\" has consistenly been singled out as one of the best things about Apple Intelligence. Plus it's less than 2 years old, and they built an entire ad campaign around it.\n\nThen again, perhaps they want to pretend that campaign never happened\n\n> provide proactive suggestions\n\nPlease tell me this does not mean Clippy.\n\nI find it kind of hard to imagine what \"proactive suggestions\" I'd welcome. As it is there are things it does that I don't like but don't have a choice about.\n\nFor example, every month or two I used to get a notification from Siri asking me if I want to create an automation to turn on personal focus automatically when I get home. I don't, because I don't use focus modes other than sleep and driving. Eventually I had to manually go in to focus modes and one-by-one delete these focus modes which I never created in the first place.\n\nAnd that's *without* this proactive Siri. \n\nSo if it's more of that \"hey, would you like to use this feature that you have no use for?\" stuff, then I don't want this. Same if it's \"hey, you sometimes use feature x, would you like to use feature x now?\"\n\nBut possibly the worst potential application is that it'll be used to serve ads. Apple have been stepping up their ad programme recently and it's not outside the realm of possibility that a Siri with proactive suggestions might occasionally suggest an app it thinks you might like\n\n> remember past conversations.\n\nI wonder about this. I can see upsides and downsides. The two biggest issues I can think of are a) that once it's got too much context it might slow it down if it has to check everything you say for prior context, and b) the problem with anything with algorithmic suggestions is that you end up with your interface narrowing and narrowing in scope. Like the longer you are on YouTube the harder it is to find new things, even if you use their \"show me something new\" button. I could potentially see a similar problem here.\n\nI dunno. This is the most ambiguous about how it could go. But I can definitely envision a version where it actually takes longer to do things because you'll say one thing and it'll then use past context to decide that you actually meant something else and then you have to spend extra time correcting it.",

If any, I would argue Apple Music and Cloud probably subsidizing Apple TV.\n\nSpotify is spending big on podcasting and entertainers within the service; while Apple is keeping it basic, which is pretty sufficient.\n\nIf and when Apple increases prices, it will be to push for more bundling to support TV part of it, the core of Apple services in cloud, app store, and music are already profitable",

I often need to refer back to older presentations, or I steal layouts from ones I've made before, but if they are dipping their toes into making that software subscription-based, I will not be paying for them. \n\niWork is \"nice to have.\" It isn't necessary. MS Office is necessary. I pay for it for myself, and I also have it through work. Using Keynote instead of Powerpoint when I was working alone or collaborating with another Mac user was nice, but no matter what I *need* PowerPoint, so I pay for it.\n\nApple really ought to be reminded that they are the \"nice to have\" company. I still can't do my whole job with macOS. I still need Windows. I can usually get away with running it via Parallels, but some of the stuff I do needs hardware unless I want to wait for a day for a model to converge or whatever, so I still have both a Windows desktop and a Windows laptop.\n\nI could do 100% of my job on Windows.\n\nI can do 95% of my job on the Mac.\n\nIf I end up having to choose because Apple starts charging a subscription for its software *on top of* the higher hardware price... Well... \"100\" is bigger than \"95.\"\n\nI'm already at the point that I would like to get an Android phone, but can't because everyone else in my family is on iOS. If/when a tipping point is reached, people will bail all at once.\n\nCook is playing a dangerous game, trying to monetize anything that isn't bolted down. I switched back to Apple largely because they had the attitude of \"if you build it, they will come.\" Make great products and people will buy them. That's it. Fundamentals. Cook has turned Apple into just another money extractor, and if I have to choose a company to try to bilk me out of my hard-earned yen every time I turn around, I'll pick one that is cheaper.",

  "summary_text": "- **Apple TV** is the only topic earning celebrated status — in a community named after Apple, the product line that sparks the most genuine enthusiasm is their streaming service, not their flagship hardware\n- **Walmart** draws intense negativity (-0.520), likely reflecting anti-retail or anti-cheap-accessory sentiment among Apple’s premium-conscious user base\n- **iPad** sits firmly in divisive territory with 73 mentions, suggesting the community can’t agree on whether the tablet line is living up to its potential\n- **Liquid Glass** and **battery life** dominate conversation, with the design update generating significant discussion\n- **Tim Cook** appears frequently, with the community forming opinions about leadership that go beyond product reviews\n\nThe r/apple community runs warmer than you’d expect for a tech subreddit, but the nuance is in what they’re warm about. That **Apple TV** — arguably Apple’s least hardware-dependent product — is the most celebrated topic suggests this community values the ecosystem experience over any single device. The **App Store** appears as a frequent discussion point alongside **iPhone Pro**, hinting at a user base that thinks about platform economics, not just specs.\n\nThe **Walmart** rejection is a fascinating class signal. At -0.520 across 27 mentions, it’s the community’s strongest negative consensus, likely triggered by discussions of third-party accessories, counterfeit products, or retail experiences that clash with the premium brand identity Apple users have internalized.\n\n**Creator Studio** landing in divisive-positive territory hints at a growing creative-professional contingent within the community who care about workflow tools. The **FBI** rejection likely traces to privacy and encryption debates where the community sides firmly with Apple’s position.",
