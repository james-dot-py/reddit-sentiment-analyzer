Now she & her husband don’t want to speak to me. How do I fix this?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, going to try keep this short & sweet (also v tired so apologies for errors) but saw people were still responding to my original post. Thank you all for taking the time to do so, it’s been overwhelming but so needed & I’ve tried to take your advice to heart.\n\nI saw ‘Alice’ a few days ago. She came to our house unexpectedly (I actually had just gone out, my wife had to call me), this was after she had blocked me.\n\nI know a lot of you were upset with her (and a lot of you with her guy, but we’re getting to it) but I was just so damn happy to see her I immediately started bawling, she did too.\n\nShe apologised, so did I. We had a long conversation which I’ll kinda try to summarise. Everything that happened had been a lot for her (which is so fair) & she was having a hard time processing it, but she initially didn’t feel upset with me. Her husband had been furious though. He already isn’t our biggest fan so this really set him off, at her as well.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I don’t blame him for being upset about his car. But I do wish we had had different/better communication.\n\nHe had been fuming we hadn’t reached out sooner after baby was born & that my first message wasn’t more apologetic.\n\nIn her words, over the weeks following everything, she started to feel angry at me/us, because he convinced her to & my messaging/reaching out then was just too much in that moment.\n\nAfter our silence, she realised she wasn’t upset with me but the situation, and should be relieved everyone was okay (& even asked her husband to stop bringing it up as she was sick of it.) We agreed we really just wanted to be okay again, though she admitted she’d have to build it up slowly, because again, her husband.\n\nI also apologised again for evth & how I wish I had done things differently. She even made a small joke that she’s proud to be such a big part of her birth story, which honestly gave me more relief than anything else she’s said.\n\nI hope she will be okay. Don’t love the guy, but I can’t do more than be her friend I think.\n\nLuckily the car isn’t totalled (I was terrified of this and feel stupid for not realising it was an option, thank you all for pointing it out). Only the front seat where I was sitting was messed up (& TMI, my sweat pants took the worst of the mess, I guess). Car is already cleaned/fixed (before Alice even came), he has it back & we’ve paid back everything. He doesn’t like driving it anymore.\n\nThat’s all I think. Wife, baby & I are okay. (She’s a month old already, which is WILD.) I realised I do have so trauma left from the whole birth which mostly started to hit me when I wasn’t obsessing over Alice anymore, so gonna work on that.\n\nThank you all, for the love, the support, but also for helping me realise I should’ve done things differently. Reddit can be overwhelming, but you’ve helped me a lot.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the responses. I care way too much about what y’all think though (reddit may not be the best place for me hahaha) so gonna log off now. Thank you all loads, from the bottom of my heart.

Now her husband & she don’t want to speak to me. How do I fix this?", "selftext": "I’m very aware this sounds ridiculous but I’m so tired of worrying about this, I need some outside perspective. This all happened almost 2 weeks ago now.\n\nI was almost 38 weeks pregnant then. My partner left for an afternoon to help out her brother (which we were both fine with, she was only a 1,5 hour drive away & neither of us saw this coming) & my friend ‘Alice’ offered to come spend the day with me so I wasn’t alone.\n\nHonestly it was really nice to have her there. We just watched some movies & hung out and even though I was so uncomfortable through the day, I didn’t consider I might actually be going into labor. (I had been feeling discomfort for ages.)\n\nAt some point we did realise this was the real deal & I called my wife. We considered waiting until she got back but things started to get real very fast & I asked Alice to drive me to the hospital. (She was fine with this, I think.)\n\nWe didn’t fully make it to the hospital & I ended up having my daughter in her (husband’s) car. We’re both fine, luckily. I had a few complications which are now okay again. Our baby is beyond perfect & though my wife is having hard time with having missed her birth, we have a wonderful tiny human to focus on.\n\nThings have been really messed up with Alice & her husband though and I don’t know how to solve it. Two days after all that happened I sent her a message thanking her again for everything she had done & told her (lighthearted but sincere) to please send me a bill for having the car cleaned. She didn’t reply for a while & in the end just ‘liked’ the message.\n\nI’ve messaged her a few times since & she hasn’t replied & her husband sent me a message saying not to message her and congrats on the baby but thanks for fucking up his car.\n\nI feel so lost & please don’t get me wrong, of course my priority is with myl ittle family right now, but this does keep crossing my mind. This is so unlike her. Her husband & I never were the closest (I don’t love how he speaks to her sometimes) but still were friendly.\n\nI don’t know how to solve this. Did I just traumatise her so much & need to leave her alone? Do I keep trying? I’m so grateful for all she’s done that day.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the replies, this is quite overwhelming so I hope it’s okay I do this here. I’m going to try & reach out to her again but not through text, or maybe I can ask one of our mutual friends to meet up with her. I don’t know yet, but going to try and check in on her in some way.\n\nAlso we planned to pay them back since this happened, no worries. Very aware that I messed up their car in a big way.\n\nThanks for all the replies, truly. I got a lot of great advice/insights & I’m gonna figure out my next steps.\n\nEdit 2: I’ve reached out to her and apologised once again for everything I’ve put them through, both car and trauma wise. And said once more that I’d really like to pay to fix all of this, regardless of the cost, or if they want I can try to reach out to some professionals & try to sort everything ourselves. Anything to make it right, as well as asking if they want me to rent them something. Though I think my sincerity in my first message (to pay evth) was clear, I don’t want to take any chances. (I will add that any other message I had sent her was very serious/worried, I never joked about paying.)\n\nThank you all for your comments. I feel awful about what I did to their car. I’ll make it right, as we were planning to, but try to be more proactive about it.\n\nThis all has been quite overwhelming, but very needed. Thank you for taking the time to reply. I’m gonna sleep now, it’s been an emotional day.\n\nEdit 3: She’s deleted/blocked me now, I’m at a loss. I’ll continue trying to make this right & reach out some places to get some estimates/contact insurance/so on. We’re taking this very seriously, I promise.\n\nThough I appreciate all you guys so much for helping me see how badly we dealt with this, I really need to get away from this post for a bit.

Is there any saving our marriage?", "selftext": "I’ll try to keep this update short. I wanted to say thank you to everyone who took the time to comment and message me. For those who didn’t read the original post I made, I will link it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/1nywu56/my\\_36m\\_wife\\_34f\\_fell\\_deep\\_into\\_conspiracy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nywu56/my_36m_wife_34f_fell_deep_into_conspiracy/)\n\nSome of you helped me accept a reality I had been avoiding for a long time: my soon to be ex-wife was not going to get better, and I had to act to protect my daughter. I also want to specifically thank those who pointed me to the QAnon Casualties sub. Reading other families’ stories and seeing how similar the patterns were was incredibly validating. It helped me understand that this wasn’t something I could love or wait my way out of.\n\nI took the advice of some commenters and started documenting my ex's neglect of our daughter, her racism and extreme beliefs and reached out to a divorce lawyer. I checked on our joint bank accounts as advised and discovered that she had been withdrawing large sums of money from a joint account we opened early in our marriage for family vacations etc and that we had discussed using to eventually set up a college fund for our daughter when she was born. When I confronted her, she initially denied taking the money. When I demanded she show me where the money went, she went on a long rant about \"creating a better world.\"\n\nShe admitted she had donated money to organizations like TPUSA, claiming they would “create better schools” and “keep kids safe.” She had also spent a significant amount on designer handbags, shoes, and clothing that she had hidden from me. The craziest thing is she was also being scammed by someone she met through some royal gossip subreddit who claimed to have hired a private investigator to expose Meghan Markle. Apparently, this person would send her negative articles about Meghan Markle and claim that the private investigator had discovered this information and sent it to the press and my wife would send more money. She told me all of this as if it were completely reasonable and saw nothing wrong with it.\n\nI told her I was filing for divorce and at first she thought I was joking but then exploded at me and began throwing things while ranting about me breaking up the family. A glass cup she threw hit me in the head. I left the house bleeding and went to my neighbor’s, who called the police. She had trashed the kitchen by the time the police showed up and they arrested her after I explained what happened.\n\nI applied for and was granted a Domestic Violence Restraining Order, along with temporary custody of my daughter. My wife currently has supervised visitation only. She is facing a misdemeanor criminal charge related to the domestic battery incident, which is being handled in criminal court alongside the ongoing divorce proceedings. She is currently living with a former coworker, and her family has reached out to express support for me and my daughter.\n\nI am in the middle of divorce proceedings, and my lawyer believes I have a strong case for sole custody. This isn’t how I ever imagined things ending, but I’m grateful I listened to the advice here when I did. My priority now is my daughter’s safety, stability, and emotional well-being.

It’s been a while and I’m not sure if you guys will even remember me or my post lol. A lot has happened and I’ve just been overwhelmed. I want to say thank you to everyone who gave advice, the original post got over 2 million views so there were tons of comments and I read them all even if I didn’t respond. I did not expect it to blow up like that.\n\nBefore I give the update I want to give some clarifications about frequently asked questions on the original post:\n\n1. my boyfriend told me that all his coworkers were a lot older than him, but that was when we were discussing other coworkers months prior so I understand why he didn’t happen to mention the one exception (Amy) since she wasn’t on topic. He was making a generalization.\n\nSo, update time:\n\nI did end up talking to Jake. I struggled finding a good time to bring it up because we ended up being invited on a spontaneous trip with our friends shortly after I made my post, but I ended up talking to him when we had a moment alone at the hotel. I explained how those behaviors made me feel, and he told me he wanted to discuss this but wasn’t sure how to bring it up either since we didn’t talk about it when it happened. I was so emotionally defeated the night we got home from the bar that I went to sleep without a word.\n\nAnyways, Jake told me that he was also completely caught off guard by how Amy was acting at the bar. He said that while she did make odd comments every now and then, she had never physically done anything until that night, and he let their other female coworker know he was uncomfortable with how Amy acted at the bar, and she agreed and said she would not schedule him with Amy anymore since she manages the schedule. I mentioned in my last post that Amy was constantly boasting about sleeping with a bunch of men and sending them pictures or whatever. I interpreted this as “she’s trying to tell him he’s down to do anything with anyone, including him. She’s telling him she’s interested, she’s telling him she likes having sex”. Jake however, interpreted the flirty comments as her personality because she was that way with everyone, and interpreted the sleeps-with-a-bunch-of-men-boasting as “I’m not interested in you personally though” which is why he didn’t find it odd.\n\nYou know how when you start talking to someone of the opposite sex, they’ll casually slip in a mention of their girlfriend/boyfriend as a way to let you know they’re already taken and are only interacting with you platonically? He thought it was like THAT, and THAT was why she kept mentioning whoever she was seeing at the time.\n\nDuring our conversation Jake reassured me that he loves me and only wants me, he apologized for not resolving this sooner and that he just felt super awkward at the bar when he realized what she was doing and he didn’t know how to react. He mentioned that he would never do anything with Amy, or anyone like Amy, and that he found her promiscuity and emotional instability to be unattractive. He believed that the reason she suddenly started being so handsy with him that night at the bar was because I was there and that must have made her lash out, but he promised it had never happened before that.\n\nAfter this conversation, and him showing me texts from his coworker stating he won’t be scheduled with Amy anymore, I felt a lot better. Until, Jake told me he wanted to talk one day. He said that even though he wasn’t scheduled on the same shifts as Amy anymore, she started switching shifts with people to work with him. Because of that, he started applying to jobs and later on let me know he got accepted to be a field technician at (redacted for privacy\\*). He put his two weeks in at his current job and now, he only has one week left until he starts. It’s a field he’s more interested in, has better pay, AND obviously Amy won’t be there. Overall I’m currently happy and feel a lot better that he cut her, (and soon that entire work environment) out of our lives.\n\nWe’ve been talking about a lot of things since then, better communication, how we can enforce boundaries even when it’s awkward. I know this update is going to make a lot of people displeased, most responses wanted me to end our relationship, but, I’m happy with where things are going currently.

No ring, nothing, and it is a pattern that she will beg for him to be active, he gives her crumbs and she will try to convince everyone (even herself) that it is the best thing anyone has ever done for anyone.\n\nWhen talking about the upcoming wedding, every senetence is about what he wants and how he will enjoy the day and there are two main aspects which I know her other friends and family dislike.\n\n1. No plus ones, but not in the traditional sense but for example, I am not allowed to bring my husband because \"he isn't  close friends with the couple\". So not just no boyfriends and random people, also no fiances and no husbands unless they are also very close friends of the couple.\n2. There will be no expenses paid for the guests.

His usual caring self.\n\nThen he became overly sweet, it kind of felt fine in the beginning but when he started making comments and jokes about how he wanted me to remember how amazing he was as a boyfriend it started to feel weird.\n\nIt kind of felt like he was guilting me.\n\nAfter reading the comments I started to notice more things too.\n\nHe always asked questions about where I was going and who I was seeing, which isn’t new but i started to see it differently now.\n\nThen he started asking more questions whenever I was on my phone, asking who I was texting and what I was saying.\n\nThen he started reading the messages over my shoulder.

As in if I was in the shopping centre he would ask me which stores I was going to, what I was eating, he asked me for photos of the food I was having. I thought it was cause he wanted to be involved but I was dumb.\n\nI’m kinda ashamed to say that I did send him all of those photos and all the proof he needed for a couple of days, but then I got sick of it.\n\nI asked him why does he need all of that information and he told me “just cause I want to make sure”.\n\nI asked make sure of what?\n\nHe didn’t really give me an answer.\n\nThen the final straw was about two days ago, another argument, this time about Ella.\n\nHe said Ella was trying to manipulate me into getting back with Sam. That she always had a vendetta against him.\n\nI said he was being stupid because if that were true she wouldnt invite him to the damn wedding.\n\nHe said he didn’t feel comfortable with me going, he said he didn’t want me to go, and if I did I was crossing his boundaries and that I wouldn’t be his girlfriend anymore because what kind of girlfriend would purposely cross their boyfriends boundaries.\n\nSo I told him that’s okay, I wouldn’t want to cross his boundaries and broke up with him.\n\nYou were all right, he was controlling me.\n\nI don’t feel happy about it. I feel sad.\n\nI feel like I wasted years of my life on someone I loved.\n\nI told ella, she didn’t celebrate, she was sad for me too. Said he was nice but I could do better and I should be with someone who helps me grow my world, not shrink it to being just them.\n\nI’m going to focus on looking forward to the wedding and helping Ella out. Thank you to everyone again.\n\nEdit: I know I know… mentioning the reddit advice of “break up” being bad and what I ended up doing was a bit ironic! I just meant a lot of people immediately went to breaking up with him. Honestly I probably wouldn’t have if the post ended with him just being a bit grumpy and then moving on, it was the behaviour that followed that made that decision for me.\n\nIt’s one thing to be a bit off about something and then need a discussion, another thing to then be weaponising boundaries and monitoring my every move, that is what made me break up with him.\n\nAgain, I am so grateful for the support and advice everyone has given me.

This has never happened before and I drew a hard line.\n\nFirst part. My husband overdid it a bit on the booze on boxing day. No incidents just a bit too much.

My husband was pissed off but brushed it off the next day.\n\nJump to December 28th. I had my side of the family.over for a Christmas Movie/Board game Night.  The night went well! around 7:30 the power went out so people started to leave. There was freezing rain, and we couldn't buy salt due to a local shortage (still ongoing). My cousin went out and slipped. My dad caught him. He came back inside and chewed us out about not having salt. We explained we didn't have any and why. \n\n My dad then decided to go outside alone in the dark after knowing it was freezing rain, after seeing my cousin fall, to do who knows what. He slipped and fell. He bruised himself but had no major injuries. He drove himself and my mom home after, so he was fine.\n\nWe offered him ice and Tylenol, and I said now that hes over 60 he can't be doing that kind of thing alone. He sharply said \"don't question my abilities.\" Then chewed us out AGAIN this time in front of the family. \n\nAt this point it got awkward and people wanted to leave. We got kitty litter, flashlights, and helped everyone to their cars slowly one by one, safely in the dark and freezing rain. No more falls. \n\nI gave my dad 24 hours to cool off and I text him on the 30th asking how hes feeling and if he is OK. He proceeds to say he blames only my husband (and not me???) for not having salt and that he contacted the municipality and the region and that he got a lawyer to sue us. He said he has told the whole family he is doing this (like he is proud of it?)

There were some major anger incidents over the years. \n\nI just don't know what to do at this point. Part of me wants to unblock him and send him a message outlying the broken trust and hurt he caused. Explain to him what he needs to do to try to earn it back.

He’s in the military  and before anyone jumps in with “all military men cheat,” I’m not trying to hear that right now.\n\nOn February 5th, he told me he tested positive for chlamydia. He was very calm about it. I work from home, and he came into the office and said, “I need to talk to you when you have a second.” I finished what I was doing and went to talk to him.\n\nHe said, “So you know how I got tested today? Well… I tested positive for chlamydia. Did you sleep with anyone while I was away?”\n\nI was shocked. I said, “Oh wow, omg. You tested positive? How? No, I did not sleep with or kiss anyone while you were away. Did you sleep with anyone? Because I know for a fact I didn’t.”\n\nHe said, “No, I would never sleep with anyone. I was deployed and working the entire time. I barely had time for myself.”\n\nSo now I’m sitting there thinking… then how is this possible…\n\nI told him I’d go get tested immediately, hoping maybe it was a false positive. I left work early and got tested. Two days later, my results came back: positive. I have chlamydia…. \n\nI’m in shock. I’m crying. I’m overthinking. I’m trying to find any possible loophole, any explanation for how this could happen,,, but the truth is, there is no way this happens without one of us cheating.\n\nTIMELINE\n\nHe was gone from September 2025 to December 13th, 2025.\nI got an IUD on November 20th and had STI testing done that same day  everything came back negative. So the only “window” where I could’ve supposedly hooked up with someone else was the three weeks between that test and when he came home.\n\nBut during that time, I was visiting my parents for Thanksgiving. When I came home the week of December 8th, I was working and preparing for his arrival. I learned how to make butter chicken for the first time for him, made a welcome home sign, I cleaned the whole apartment I was so excited.\n\nHe came home, and obviously we had sex. A lot. Everything seemed great until December 29th, when he said he could feel my IUD poking him. The doctor had told me that was normal, but then he said his penis was swollen and hurting a little. That was weird, so I messaged my doctor. \nI told the doctor he was having irritation after intercourse, discomfort, itching, and that he felt a poking sensation. I asked if it could be related to my IUD.\nDoctors response:\nThe poking sensation is likely from the IUD strings, but the irritation and discomfort are probably not related.\n\nAt the time, I didn’t think much of it. But now, typing this out, that was a very clear sign of chlamydia. I got my IUD removed not because of him but for other medical reasons and switched to Nexplanon. He didn’t mention any more irritation, and I didn’t have symptoms, so I didn’t even consider cheating back then.\n\nNow we’re here. Both of us tested positive. And I’m losing my mind. I’ve researched. I talked to my doctor. Every single explanation leads back to the same conclusion: he had sex with someone else.\nI told him this. I said, “Please just tell me the truth. I won’t be mad. I just want honesty.”\nHe said, “I’m telling you the truth. You’re the only person I’ve had sex with in this relationship.”\nThat phrasing didn’t hit me until later. He’s the type of person who avoids “lying” by being technically truthful. Saying “in this relationship” instead of “in general” is… suspicious idk just a random thought.\n\nHe left yesterday for training. He’s supposed to come back Friday, but he could deploy again at any moment. So now I’m home alone with all of this.\n\nHe keeps saying we can go to the doctor together and ask how this is possible if neither of us cheated. And part of me thinks, “If he’s willing to go to the doctor, maybe he’s not lying.” But realistically, he’s just clinging to confusion because it’s safer than admitting the truth.\nI know he’s lying because I know I didn’t cheat. But he won’t admit it. I don’t know how to get the truth out of him. I just want him to say it so I can stop spiraling.\n\nHe’s acting completely normal! He’s talking about our future, being loving with me and this is all normal we always are loving and talk about our future and goals. But all of this is making me feel insane! My heart hurts. I’m confused. And now that he’s gone, I can finally think clearly without his actions convincing we’re okay. \n\nI’m planning to start packing my things and move back in with my parents. But I feel like I need him to just say he cheated so I can feel some kind of closure.\n\nI don’t know what to do.\n", "author": "No_Breadfruit_5575", "score": 4025, "num_comments": 2038, "created_utc": 1770677968.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r0jl7z/boyfriend_28m_tested_positive_for_chlamydia_and/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r0jl7z/boyfriend_28m_tested_positive_for_chlamydia_and/"}, {"id": "1qfb7fa", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "My (31M) girlfriend (28F) of 1.5 years told me to \"be a man\" and console her when my mom died, instead of supporting me.

She wasn’t happy and started arguing saying it’s only a crush and it’ll pass and she’s making good progress and then started to frame it as me not caring about her health. Once she realised I wasn’t budging she started trying to bargain with me and saying what if she stopped seeing the personal trainer could she still go to the gym and if she started having sex with me again we don’t need couples counselling.\n\nI lost my temper at this point I admit and shouted “enough! I want to know everything! Tell me everything you’ve done! I want to read your messages with him! I want to see these outfits you are wearing! I need to know everything now!” She said fine and stormed off upstairs. She came back down wearing an outfit that was a bit much to be fair for the gym in a cold country but I didn’t say anything and asked to see her phone. She said she deleted the messages. When I asked why she was honest and said she sent him a topless selfie on Christmas Day while I was downstairs cooking the dinner for her bloody family! She then said that while she’s confessing she also kissed another man on a night out in the first year of our relationship. I already knew this because her friend who fancied me at the time told me about it.\n\nI asked her why him and not me. What’s he got that I haven’t.  She said nothing and it was more about the situation than him. She said she’s starting to feel regret and like she missed out on her youth. She had a boyfriend from school to her early 20s, was single for a year and then met me. She said she’s started to regret not having more fun and she’s starting to enjoy attention from other men more and more especially younger men. When she was telling me originally she said a couple of times “I’m not planning on doing anything it’s just a fantasy, unless you want me to do something” with a nervous laughter and at the time it felt a bit like she wanted to do something but was trying to frame it as my idea but I never really clicked properly. I asked her if when she told me she was expecting me to give her permission and she said she genuinely thought because I don’t get jealous I’d be ok with it\n\nI still feel like I wasn’t being given everything though. The outfit and the kiss confession felt like distractions and something was missing. Even telling me about all this in the first place felt a bit like ah was trying to get her story in before someone else told me. I said I’m going for a drive and then went to the gym to speak to her personal trainer. I approached him and said I’m not here for trouble I understand my wife has been harassing you. He wasn’t happy being approached this way which I get but he asked me who my wife was and when I told him he said he knew something like this was going to happen. He told me that he hadn’t trained her since Christmas as he let her go after she had been sending pictures (plural not just the one she told me about). He said since then she had kept messaging but he ignored her. He let me read the messages and she had sent 12 pictures over a three month period. One was fully naked and when he told her not to send them she said she was just showing her progress. The worst part though was she was messaging him stuff like “we’ve had another argument could really do with a session to burn off some anger” and “he’s out drinking with his friends again ignoring me, I’m so lonely” neither of which are true and then she told him mid December that she had kicked me out and we were divorcing! With the Christmas Day picture she even said “first Christmas alone” and just last week she messaged him saying I was already seeing someone else!\n\nI thanked him and asked him to send me them and went home. When I got home she was already gone and just wrote me a note saying sorry. She’s at her friend’s house and we’ve been texting a bit the last couple of days and have a marriage counsellor booked for next week but I think it’s done. I’m not even that bothered about the pictures or the flirting or the outfit. The lying about me and our marital status. I don’t drink and we hadn’t argued in years.

He’s exceptionally good with money, having come from a privileged family with a successful real estate business. He is strict with his budgeting. His parents instilled in him excellent financial habits, which he’s carried into adulthood. My mom was a single parent and a school teacher, so we didn’t have a lot of money but we were ok. Both of us earn a good income, exceeding $100,000.\n\nHowever, I’ve never been particularly good with money due to various reasons, including past financial trauma, a lack of financial literacy during my upbringing, and lifestyle creep. My partner and I are both committed to getting married, but he has a specific requirement for us to undergo a comprehensive financial disclosure and for me to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. This includes a criminal background check, credit checks, and the need to show all our bank accounts and savings. At the time I was transparent about my debt and financial situation, and he has done the same. Naturally, he has significantly more invested than I do and better credit. To make him feel comfortable marrying me, he has set a few financial goals for me to achieve:\n\n1. Pay off all my consumer credit card debt.\n\n2. Build an emergency fund that covers 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses.\n\n3. Make substantial payments towards my student loans, which amount to over $100,000.\n\nWell, things between us haven’t been great the past couple of months. We’ve been arguing over minor things around the house. Which has triggered me to compulsively shop. We had been arguing so much so that right before my boyfriend left for a weekend trip he suggested I talk to my job/manager to see what my options would be for me to temporarily move back to my hometown for two months so he could have some space and figure out what he wants. He also wanted to go no contact during this time. I told him that was a lot to ask, even though my job is mostly remote as my life is where we live. According to my contract, I have to be in the same state as my job. He insisted I lie to my job and say something was going on with my mom back home and ask my manager if I could work from my home state to “take care of her” to give him space. I did ask my job and manager, and they basically told me I would have to take FMLA to do something like that. So that wasn’t an option. When I asked him if he would honor his word and give me a couple of months to move if we decided to break up upon my return, he basically said no. He wouldn’t be willing to do that. Which shocked me because he’s usually a man of his word. I’m not from the state where we live and have no family or friends here. So this obviously scared me, so I started looking for places to live and applied for apartments that night out of fear. I ended up getting approved for my dream apartment and toured it last week. I really liked it and wanted to move there. I felt that this would give us some space and offer me a bit more freedom and security than I was feeling. \n\nWhen he got back from his weekend trip, I told him I couldn’t go back home as I had to stay in the state due to my job, and he just said that was fine and for us to just continue working on the relationship. When I told my him I found a new apartment, he was upset. Basically saying me going out and finding an apartment was sneaky, and he doesn’t see how we are going to continue to work on things if I’m living somewhere 20 minutes away. He also brought up how it would be harder for me to meet the financial goals we set if I had my own place as I’d be paying much more in rent/utilities. He also said that me moving out would be a major inconvenience for him as I do all the cooking in the house, grocery shopping, most of the cleaning, etc. My boyfriend can’t cook. \n\nSo he basically has been treating me like a piece of furniture/silent treatment the past two days until I made a decision on whether I was moving out or not. When I told him I wanted to stay, he asked about my progress on the financial goals, and I told him I hadn’t made much progress on anything except the emergency fund. He has now drawn a bit of a line in the sand and said in 6 months-1 year, if I haven’t accomplished the goals we set, he’s not going to move forward with us getting married, and we might as well break up at that point. This made me nervous as he asked me during the conversation if I’d racked up any additional credit card debt. I said no, out of fear. The truth is I have, and it’s basically tripled. I don’t know how to tell him this. He’s super perfect financially, and I’m not, and I feel like he’s super fed up with me.

I always dress up and wear costumes/sparkles for each themed event we host. Dustin randomly asked if he could use some of my sparkles, so I gave them the bottle not thinking much of it because he often does dress up when we throw parties that involve costumes. Tim held the bottle while he put sparkles on Dustin’s hand and then the next thing I know his hand is down the front of my shirt grabbing at my bare chest.\n\nDustin then removed his hand from my top and looked at his friend Tim who then put more sparkles in his hand and again he forcefully put his hand back down my shirt.

We've been married 27 years, to help as you wade through this.\n\nLet me start by saying I (F53) don't have a relationship with my husband's (M62) brother (M61) and haven't spoken to him since we moved 1000+ away 15 years ago.  Back then, he was a drunk who never took accountability for the vicious things he said and did, and never expressed a crumb of gratitude for anything anyone did for him.  He and my husband have rekindled their sibling relationship.  I'm an only child, so I don't claim to understand that kind of thing in any way.  So I stay out of it, it's not my business, and he talks to his brother when he talks to him, and I have no input or interest in any of it.  But this brother has no concerns if I'm alive or dead.  I mean less than nothing to this man.\n\nSo, I lost my father (M81) last week, on Monday.  Friday, I went with my mother to pick up his ashes at the funeral home.  So, Dad had been gone for five days at that point, and as I picked him up in that little box, I happened to see a big, black chimney on the property, and I realized that was the building where they did cremations.  And suddenly, it all was so REAL in that moment.  It all hit me at once.  I get home, and I allow myself 15 minutes of falling apart in my living room, in the privacy of my own home that I work to pay for just as much as Husband does.\n\nHusband doesn't comfort me in any way.\n\nBut I still have responsibilities, right?  I get myself together, and I leash up my dogs to take them out.  As I return home, I take their walkies stuff off and take them into the kitchen to feed them.  That's when I hear Husband in his office, talking on the phone to his brother.  He says, \"This is the first effect I've seen since he died.\"  And on the speaker phone, I hear his brother say, \"Well, she's just going to have to accept reality.\"  Again, it's been FIVE days.\n\nI felt so betrayed.  It's ok to talk ABOUT me to someone who doesn't care if I even exist, but not TO me about what I might be going through?  They sounded like the old men hecklers on the Muppet Shows, sitting up there in the balcony and judging everything.  Why is my grief over my father up for discussion with HIS brother?  Don't I have a right to privacy in my own home?  So I ask him, wtf, dude?  And instead of trying to understand where I'm coming from, he doubles down and insists he did nothing wrong, and he can betray all the things I tell him in confidence any time he wants.  I told him how I feel about ANYTHING isn't his brother's business, and my grief isn't either of their concern.  Sit in there and talk amongst yourselves then, but don't be surprised when I never tell you anything ever again.  Why is THIS such a big deal, he asks, and not all the other things I've told him???  Wait, what???  You told him OTHER things???  You've talked about me with someone who hates me BEFORE????  I'm just so hurt, and I feel so betrayed.  I'm a private person, and I would NEVER talk about my husband to my family behind his back like that.  I don't feel safe with him anymore.\n\nOver the weekend, we tried to talk about it again.  And all he does is get defensive and tries to make these crazy statements like,  \"So that's it, then?  This marriage is over?\"  And, \"So, since you hate me, I can just do whatever I want now?\"  Like, what?  But his position remains unchanged.  He did nothing wrong.  Won't back down enough to even meet me in the middle.\n\nWe've been married 27 years.  I no longer feel safe or respected.  I honestly don't know where to go from here.  Be married to your brother, then, if that's the way you feel.  But leave me alone.\n\nAfter all this, yesterday afternoon, I was changing the sheets on the bed, and he walked up behind me and grabbed me in the most vulgar way.  HOW did he think that was ok after all THAT???  And I said, \"What are you doing?  DO NOT DO THAT.  Don't touch me.\"  And of course, he got all pissy and defensive again and stormed out of the house and spent the rest of the day in his shop.  Fine with me.  I just feel so gross and betrayed and disrespected.  I'm not something for them to dissect to determine if I'm grieving 'correctly.'\n\nTLDR: I feel betrayed by my husband and like there is no middle ground until my husband can at least admit that talking about me behind my back was wrong, especially with a man who doesn't care about me in ANY way.

Things definitely took a turn for the worse... if that was even possible\n\nBrief summary, my mom took pictures of my GF's ID while we were away, I found out.\n\nAfter discovering those first photos, I asked my girlfriend to meet me for dinner so I could explain the situation to her in person. She was understandably upset and scared, but she appreciated my honesty and the fact that I told her asap. However, she made it clear that she no longer feels comfortable or safe coming to my house, which I completely respect.\n\nI finally had a serious confrontation with my mom, and she didn't even try to deny it. In fact, she admitted with terrifying calmness that she has done this with every single one of my previous partners. Not only that, but she also has done it to my siblings' partners as well.  She insists she doesn't do this to steal identities or commit fraud; in her mind, she is doing it strictly for security reasons to protect the family. However, seeing the folders/files she had on everyone was absolutely mortifying. My siblings have been married to their respective partners for over 10 years, and she still kept those files on them. I'm definitely telling them next.\n\nShe had photos of IDs belonging to my sister-in-law, brother-in-law, and many of my friends. But the thing that made my skin crawl was finding a picture she had taken of a thong I had recently bought as a gift for my girlfriend.\n\nI forced her to delete every single photo and backup in front of me. I made sure to empty the \"Recently Deleted\" folder and the trash on her phone and cloud storage to ensure nothing was left.\n\nSeeing that she has no remorse, I realized I couldn't stay there for another minute. I’ve officially moved out and I'm currently crashing at my best friend's apartment. My girlfriend doesn't blame me, but we are maintaining a strict boundary with my mother. No contact. I’m still processing this total betrayal of trust.\n\nSince I left, my mother has been sending me money, about 100,000 Argentine Pesos (roughly $100 USD give or take) every couple hours to try and bribe me to come back and I have ignored her completely.\n\nI am honestly devastated. I feel like I’ve lived for 24 years with a person I didn’t even know. Seeing this side of her has completely shattered my perception of so many things. It’s a level of betrayal that I’m still struggling to process.\n\nI also want to thank everyone who commented on my previous post; your support and perspective gave me the strength to confront her and take the necessary steps to protect my partner and my own sanity.

He’s done this before where he’s fallen asleep at a hotel and luckily the concierge gave me a key anyway (even though my name wasn’t on the booking). I had to order another uber home and it’s ended up being expensive and he knows I’m strapped for cash so that added salt to the wound. It wasn’t a last minute thing, he’d planned this a few days ago. I felt so angry and embarrassed coming back home when I was so excited to spend the next couple of days with him. It’s been 3 hours since and I still haven’t heard from him.

It was definitely an accident.We’re both 20 yo. We’re in college and have only been dating for 8 months. Let’s be real, we messed up.\n\nI told her I’d support whatever she decided and I meant that even though it scared me. Internally I kind of freaked out when she said she wanted to keep the baby. I’ve been trying to mentally accept that I’m going to be a dad and I still can’t really wrap my head around it. I love her and I want to be a good dad. I just honestly have no idea what I’m doing. My parents are pissed and think I’m ruining my life.\n\nShe had an ultrasound a few weeks ago. I went with her and when I saw the baby I was surprised by the sudden rush of happiness I felt. Like genuinely happy. It was this rush mixed with absolute panic because it suddenly felt real. Before that, part of me was quietly hoping there wasn’t actually a baby and it was all some mistake. I didn’t think I’d be mad at all if there was just nothing on the screen at all.\n\nEverything looked normal on the ultrasound, but they found a spot on the baby’s heart. The doctor said it can be nothing and sometimes disappears, but it can also be a marker for things like Down syndrome. The moment she said that I just felt a giant knot form in my stomach. \n\nThe doctor said sometimes those spots mean nothing and since my girlfriend is so young that chances were probably still pretty good that everything was fine with the baby. She recommended  blood test to screen for Down syndrome and other things. Yesterday we got the results that there’s a high risk of trisomy 21 aka Down syndrome. It said the risk was 84%. I don’t really get exactly how that percentage is figured out. Everything else was low risk. The baby is a boy.\n\nThere’s another test we can do pretty much confirm one way or another. My girlfriend doesn’t know if she wants to do it yet. She’s completely overwhelmed, which I get since it’s barely been 12 since we found out. She basically shut down emotionally and didn’t want to talk about it anymore.\n\nI feel like I’m drowning. I was already terrified about having a baby at all. We aren’t prepared for a perfectly healthy kid, let alone one who may have serious medical needs. I was still in the process of convincing myself we could do this. I keep reading that Down syndrome isn’t just developmental. It can come with heart problems and lifelong health issues.\n\nI don’t know what I feel. Part of me wants to be strong and supportive no matter what. Another part of me is scared out of my mind and wondering how we’re ever going to handle this. It just feels impossible to me. I’m not prepared to handle all of this. I feel like I shouldn’t even be allowed to be responsible for somebody else, let alone somebody with special needs and health issues. \n\nI understand that she’s overwhelmed, but her behavior toward me has changed in ways I don’t know how to respond to.\n\nShe barely talks to me now unless it’s about something practical. If I ask how she’s feeling, she says she doesn’t want to talk about it or changes the subject. She’s spending way more time alone, scrolling on her phone or watching videos with headphones in. When I try to be there for her physically, like sitting with her or checking in, she feels distant and uncomfortable, almost like she doesn’t want me around.\n\nWhat’s confusing is that she still expects me to be supportive, but I don’t know what that means when she won’t communicate with me at all. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. I don’t want to push her when she’s clearly struggling, but I also feel shut out and useless.\n\nAt the same time, I’m dealing with my own fear. I was already scared about becoming a parent at our age, and now I’m panicking internally about finances, school, and whether I’m capable of handling everything that might come with this.\n\nI don’t know if I should keep giving her space, even though it feels like she’s pulling away from me, or if I should push for a real conversation even if it upsets her in the short term.\n\nHow do you support somebody who shuts you out during a crisis?

There is a room i think you would love, it’s a music room/bar” \n\nHe said “yeah no they don’t know how to renovate, i don’t think i would love anything from this” and he laughed. I was honestly disgusted. And i said “what because they’re gay?? When did you start having a grudge against gay people” he said “i hung out with them so much the way they talk is so unnatural and i don’t like hearing it anymore”\n\nHe then noticed our son was looking at the TV and was like “no you don’t need to be looking at this, he doesn’t need to see this” \n\nand that’s when i got really mad. Yes it was trixie on tv walking around showing her house with her husband. Her drag was in no way provocative or inappropriate. Literally they were doing a house tour. No men kissing. Just a house. i said “no i’m not doing this, when did you become so homophobic, there is nothing wrong on the tv” and he said “well you watch this all the time” and i said “no i don’t ever watch this stuff, you always say negative stuff about anything i do that’s girly. That’s not how becoming gay works, him seeing a house tour” \n\nI just learned who trixie (i knew who she was but not WHO she was) was yesterday. literally from watching house remodels on tik tok. So as of yesterday,  i watch one drag queens house reveal and now our son is doomed. Is he being overbearing and controlling or am i really being inappropriate around my son?? Im starting to feel like he’s just being controlling. like every time i do something he always has something negative to say. makes me want to pack up all of my sparkle to just make him shut up.

I was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection and bronchitis. Because it was an infection, I was prescribed antibiotics. I am allergic to penicillin, so I was given a different medication.\n\nEver since I was young, taking antibiotics has almost always caused me to develop either a yeast infection or BV. I do not know why, but it has been a consistent issue for me.\n\nYesterday, I woke up feeling much better from the bronchitis, but I noticed that something felt wrong down there. I was experiencing itching, burning, and an unusual bloody smell even though I am not on my period and should not be for another ten days (sorry for the details). Based on the symptoms and the consistency of my discharge, I believe I have a yeast infection caused by the antibiotics.\n\nThat evening, my boyfriend and I were relaxing at home. He asked if I wanted to have sex, and I said no. I explained that I was uncomfortable and did not want to make the infection worse. I also told him that I felt embarrassed about the symptoms.\n\nI showed him the cream I am using to treat the infection. He offered to help apply it, and I agreed. However, during this, he began touching me in a sexual way, which caused pain and burning. I asked him to stop and told him clearly that I did not want to engage in any sexual activity. I then applied the medication myself in the bathroom.\n\nWhen I came back, he told me that our sex life is a mess. This confused me because we usually have sex two to three times a week, and I believed our sex life was healthy. He said that I am not on the same level as him and that I ruined what could have been a nice evening.\n\nI tried to explain again that this situation has nothing to do with attraction or compatibility and everything to do with my health. He then asked if I had an STD, which made me realize that he does not understand what a yeast infection or BV is.\n\nI explained that it is not an STD and that it is a common side effect of antibiotics. He responded by saying that I was making excuses to avoid sleeping with him. He said that sex is his love language and that if I cannot give that to him, he would have to leave.\n\nI ended up crying and questioning myself, but after reflecting on it, I know there is nothing wrong with me. I was sick, took prescribed medication, and now my body is dealing with the consequences.\n\nI love my boyfriend and I love our sex life. I never believed there was a problem before this. Now, I feel pressured to engage in sex while I am physically uncomfortable and in pain. I want to explain this to him without it turning into a fight or being dismissed as an excuse.\n\nUPDATE: \nSo since the day I made the post, I have been staying with my friend. \nBut last night, everything blew up. \n\nMy bf texted me saying that he wants to talk. I told him that I need more time to think everything through.\n\nHe then sent me a long text where he explained exactly how childish I am and that I am incapable of showing him love the way he wants it. \n\nWithout continuing the conversation, I just sent him a text to say it is over and that he should remove his belongings from my house (since I am the one paying the rent). \n\nHe messaged me today asking if it is the right thing to do and I simply just said that I cant be with someone who seems like they secretly hate me (I know. It was a bit harsh). \n\nAnyways. The relationship is over. \nWhile I feel sort of relieved, I am still very much hurt and dont know how I will be able to really trust someone again. \n\nMy friend is taking me out tonight for a \"getting rid of the toxicity celebration\" (she came up with it).\n\nThank you for everyone who has given me advice.

My husband is more of an introvert and I am more of an extrovert, especially when it comes to being around our close friends who I’ve known for many years. He was brought into our friend group about 3 years ago and that’s how we met. We’ve been together for 1.5 years now. We arrived at the cabin early and when everyone else started to arrive, including the hosts of the cabin, he started to get very quiet and reserved. He doesn’t usually like larger group settings but this was just a group of our 10 mutual friends that we’ve known for years, no one new or different. On Saturday morning, he said that he wanted to take my car to go skiing on the mountain before everyone woke up. I thought that sounded like a great idea for him to get some exercise and do something he really enjoyed. He left early in the morning and said he’d be back by 12-1pm. 12pm turned into 1pm, turned into 2pm. When I called him, it kept going to voicemail. I started to get concerned but just tried to tell myself that he probably didn’t have any service on the mountain. Once 4pm hit, I started to get really worried, calling his phone with no answer. Finally at around 4:30-5pm, I get a text message saying that he was home. He had gone skiing, decided that he didn’t want to come back, took my car, and left me at the cabin. When I asked him how I was going to get home, he just told me that he already contacted our friend and he said he would do it. When I approached this friend, he said that my husband doesn’t even have his phone number and definitely didn’t contact him to ask. Yes, I was surrounded by friends and someone could probably drive me home, but it still felt really shitty to have been left behind with honestly no regard to how I would get home or how leaving me without even telling me the plan would make me feel. If he didn’t want to be there he could have let me know. If he didn’t want to come, he could have stayed home.

I’m just not sure what to do with this. My friends think this is really shitty and somewhat out of character for him but they are frustrated too because they invited him to join in the celebration, and he just left without saying anything to anyone.

I had almost no savings and we never really gave details about how much we had in savings until maybe a year or so ago.\n\nOver this period she has always said she couldn’t afford things and I’ve paid a larger portion of rent (probably 70%) since we moved out together 3 years ago.\n\nI’ve never wanted to let money get in the way of living/our lives and could probably do a bit better job of saving. And I was always happy to pay more until she also started working full time when we would start splitting things evenly.\n\nMy dad passed away unexpectedly and he left me $500,000 which I got about 6 months ago - which is obviously life changing, I’ve probably never had more than $10,000 in my savings. We’ve started the process of buying a house and i was happy to put most of the money into a deposit and pay a larger portion of the mortgage until she started full time work (2y away).\n\nRight before we went to submit the application she said she actually had $50,000 in savings and should we mention that in the application. She was a bit embarrassed to bring it up. I get that she wouldn’t mention this when we first started dating, and I don’t even care about the amount, but she has actively said “I can’t afford this” and let me pay for things countless times. I asked why she left it so late to bring it up, that we should use some of it to pay for the house, and asked her how long she had had it. Basically she had it the whole time and that it was savings she accumulated since she started work as a teenager.\n\nI’m annoyed for a few reasons - she was going to let me put most of “my” money into the house without helping, and that all these years I’ve been paying a greater portion of things including rent, food, bills, overseas holidays, entertainment etc while she had waaaay more money than I ever had. I was earning more but that meant I wasn’t saving much, if anything. She also wasn’t saving much, her money was mostly from before we met.\n\nI never wanted money to get between me and anybody else, especially my partner but I feel really hurt, lied to, and taken advantage of. She’s normally great and I love her, but she isn’t the best decision maker sometimes, and I have caught her in little lies before. These lies didn’t bother me much before as they were insignificant - most of the time a laughed it off like “why would you lie about that”, but now we’ve hit something big in life and this proper lie has me worried.\n\nI’m really struggling to get past it and the relationship feels tainted now. I’m not sure I can get past it, but everything else in the relationship is great. And it’s really not a good atmosphere to be trying to buy a house.\n\nAnyone else have similar experience? Did you split or how did you regain trust?\n\nTLDR; girlfriend kept secret a large savings balance and let me pay for most things for years even though I had little savings. Only brought it up once we nearly applied for the mortgage and was about to let me pay for the whole deposit with money I got from my dad when he passed.\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who gave some insight, this has helped me understand how I'm feeling and get some fresh perspective that's been super helpful.\n\nJust to clear some things up, we live in Australia and are therefore classified as a de facto relationship so legally/financially similar to married anyway. We both aren't interested in marriage, but before this we were 100% committed to each other for life and happy and stable.\n\nWe also come from very different family situations. I too have been working since I was 15 too but have less in savings as I needed to move out and started paying rent when was going to uni, and have worked full time since I finished my degree. I've had to scrap a bit to get by and haven't received money from my parents or anyone until my dad passed. Saving a significant amount of money was definitely a luxury that I haven't been able to do until recently. My plan was to do enough to get myself through uni, get a good job, and then start saving, which I am lucky enough to be able to do now. \n\nShe lived with her parents until we moved in together so was able to save a lot more money before she moved out. Someone mentioned her saving this money is a massive green flag and I completely agree, she's certainly more conscious of keeping a safety net and that's a good thing. To clarify, I never expected her to \"drain\" her savings, but she wanted to move out just as much as I did and I think she could have contributed \\_some\\_ of this money so that I could save some money myself, knowing that when she finished her degree she would be able to save more. She also changed the degree she was studying after 2y of her first degree which has prolonged her studies, which she was partly able to do because I've been in position to support her. I think she should have been more upfront that she had some money at least after we moved out when I didn't have much - and in hindsight I could have communicated better here to.\n\nI think our different financial history in this regard has played into this issue now. She's going to be more cautious about spending savings where I used what I would of saved to get by.\n\nA lot of questions about if she asked me to pay more vs if I offered. As I said in another comment: It depends of course, it was a mix. We have always rented small 1 bedroom apartments, the cheapest we could get, but property is wildly expensive here. She said she can’t afford to pay 50% so she asked if I could pay more. But other non essentials, there were definitely times I offered to pay and am ok with that, although still feel a little misled. \n\nWe should have communicated to each other better, and I assumed things when I shouldn't have. But I don't think I was ever hiding anything, and she hasn't said that I was. And after we've talked about this its become clear that if I asked her directly what her situation was she wouldn't of told me about the money. I'm glad that she has the emergency savings, anyone of course should be able to be financially independent from their partner, but 50k a few years ago to me was a crazy amount of money.\n\n  \nAnyway, this has been a big lesson. House hunting is on pause for now and we need to work on ourselves and communication. The biggest issue for me was always the trust that I feel has been broken, and that maybe I've ignored smaller issues in the past. If we stay together we'll need to formalise our financial situation (clear rules, potentially cohab agreement etc), and if not I'll probably buy a smaller place by myself.  \nJeez that's a lot of words, if you've read this far and offered advice I appreciate you :)", "author": "KnownPart2110", "score": 1937, "num_comments": 1360, "created_utc": 1770210083.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qvnybu/my_m30_partner_f28_kept_secret_how_much_money_she/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qvnybu/my_m30_partner_f28_kept_secret_how_much_money_she/"}, {"id": "1qystdc", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "My (28M) girlfriend (26F) is giving me an ultimatum over a childhood kiss that's now a family inside joke.

She got very emotional and asked if I wanted the prenup because I'm planning to leave her once I get a Green Card (I'm here legally but not a citizen, she is a citizen). ​Honestly, I found that pretty offensive because I have worked hard and lived way below my means to be financially independent, and it means more to me than permanent residency. I'm incredibly grateful to the US for the opportunities it has provided me, but now that I have achieved my financial goals, I don't mind leaving the US. Later, she apologized for saying that. But I think it's something I’d have to keep hearing if I continued the relationship. So we ended things. \n​\n​\n​", "author": "alwaysHappy202", "score": 1820, "num_comments": 965, "created_utc": 1770173417.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qvcn4t/my_30m_last_relationship_with_28f_ended_because/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qvcn4t/my_30m_last_relationship_with_28f_ended_because/"}, {"id": "1qdfnas", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "F36 / M38 | Married 10 years — Husband reacts badly to me going to the gym, cutting my hair, and asking about dishes — am I missing something?", "selftext": "I’m posting anonymously because I’m feeling really isolated and could use outside perspective.\n\nI’m married with kids. Recently I started going to the gym again because I wanted to take better care of my health. I am overweight, and for the first time in over a decade I’m physically able to exercise without pain. In 2025 I had my gallbladder removed, and since then my chronic back spasms (which I’d had for years) completely disappeared. Feeling physically better has allowed me to start doing the work I need to so I can reclaim my health.\n\nI don’t go often, and I don’t talk to anyone there beyond basic courtesy.\n\nOne day I wore light makeup (which I do only occasionally) and decided to go to the gym that evening. My husband immediately became suspicious and accused me of “getting dolled up” to see someone there. He implied I was putting him and the kids last, accused me of being mentally checked out of the marriage, and suggested I must have a “gym boyfriend.” None of that is true.\n\nOver time, I’ve noticed he tends to equate my value with service to him, and responds with entitlement or anger when I don’t prioritize that. He often treats my autonomy as a problem and my role as service-oriented.\n\nAround the same time, we had a conflict over something very small: I asked him (for probably the hundredth time) to put dirty dishes on the right side of the sink instead of the left, because the left side is used for washing. He became extremely offended and responded by insulting my body, saying my “big ass” was in the way. That felt unnecessary and cruel for such a minor request.\n\nThe situation escalated through texts where he accused me of cheating, being deceptive, neglecting the kids, and said he might start talking to other women “to see how I like it.” I didn’t engage much because it was overwhelming.\n\nFast forward to this week, I cut my own hair. I hadn’t cut it in over a year, it was very long, and I trimmed it to a still-long length using a layering tool. For context, after my haircut my hair still reaches just past my mid back.  When my husband saw my haircut, he mocked me, crossed his eyes and used a voice to imply I was stupid, insulted my appearance, and threatened divorce. He compared what I did to shaving his head and beard.\n\nAs the conversation escalated, he became increasingly animated and said “oh my god, it looks like shit!” while jumping up and down for emphasis. It felt humiliating and excessive, especially since this was about my own hair and body.\n\nHe later said “sorry for reacting harshly,” but then gave a speech to the household about how we all need to stop arguing and follow his leadership. He continues to frame my going to the gym, making decisions about my body, or asking for small household cooperation as disrespectful and selfish.\n\nFor context, my husband has always been very flirtatious and social. He used to drive Uber/Lyft and regularly interacted with many different people as part of that work, including women who flirted with him. Obviously I never treated that as infidelity. What others do and say is out of your control, but how you respond to it is essential.\n\nHe can be charming and social with others, but at home situations like this often turn into accusations, control, or insults rather than discussion. I usually try to de-escalate conflict by staying calm, disengaging, or distracting rather than arguing back.\n\nI’m trying to understand whether I’m being unreasonable or if this is about control rather than the gym, hair, or dishes themselves. I don’t feel like I’m doing anything inappropriate, but his reactions feel extreme and degrading. I left out lots of very offensive things that he said because it was just way too much, emotionally and in quantity.\n\nI’m open to honest feedback. I just want to know if I’m missing something here.\n\nUpdate: I didn’t think it could get worse this week but it did. He signed up to go to the gym finally and went the same day. Then later that day it was my turn to go. He knew this and not only refused to give me the car keys, but hid them from me. After yelling in my face that he would give them to me when he was ready, he finally surrendered them a few minutes later. He repeatedly called me big and fat as I was walking to the car. I said, “What better reason to go to them gym right?”\n\nTo everyone who’s uncertain about my makeup application timeline, I applied LIGHT makeup in the morning, went about my day then decided to go to the gym in the evening.\n\nI’ve made an appointment to speak with a divorce lawyer, so I’m hopeful about the future.

Over the past year I have probably put over 5k into it from a new radiator to brakes and rotors and calipers and a new gas tank and brake lines and blah blah blah.

It’s also my first car I ever had and it’s been about 6 years since I got it. \n\nRecently my brakes went and I got them fixed because it’s my only mode of transportation to work and school and I cannot risk missing out on either and I have really no other way of getting there. \n\nMy car is a fucking death trap. Last month my brakes went as I was driving to his house. I had a mental breakdown and in that moment he said I need to think about getting a new car and he has said this multiple times but I just didn’t think I could afford it because I really didn’t understand how it worked to finance a car. It also needs other work done such as sway bar links and control arm bushings, not to mention my check engine light has been on for years due to an evap leak and my airbag light is on due to who knows what.

Most importantly I start a new job in a couple months where I’m commuting 6 days a week about 100 km a day. \n\nOver the past few weeks since a friend who works at a dealership has been trying to find a car for me and help me understand how I can finance within my budget.

Mostly I was scared of the change. \n\nLast night I told my boyfriend about it. We don’t live together. Our finances are separate. He has a steady corporate job and lives in a house by himself. I am just finishing my bachelors and I split rent with a roommate. I have been saving for a new car. However he told me that he doesn’t see why I need a new car when I put all that money into my current car and it’s a stupid financial decision to just go buy a new car. I tried to explain that my car terrifies me and it’s really a matter of time until I can’t save it anymore. He says what happens when my new car “blows up” after I drive it off the lot. I said that’s dramatic and that the car has a warranty on it for another 3 years but I also added an extended warranty on it after that for a total of 5. It’s a full warranty if anything happens to it it will be fixed without me needing to pay. We spat back and forth until I finally asked why he cared when it’s not his money and he said that clearly it’s a bad idea if I’m getting defensive over a simple line of questioning but to do what I want while he reconsiders what this means for “us”. \n\nFinancially there is no “us”. I’ve mentioned living together but he says it’s still too early and he’s not sure which I was understanding of. Am I an idiot and missing something?

Am I missing something about relationship interactions here that triggered her?", "selftext": "So I got invited to a boardgame club by a friend of mine, and I decided to bring my gf with (which he agreed to). About 1,5-2h before, we start getting ready. A bit later, she's finished with her shower, she walks into the room naked and, honestly, I get pretty turned on. So I go up, start kissing her, and kneel to go down on her. She accepts this eagerly, and one thing leads to another and we end up having sex. Not like the \"demons got into us and we idk what happened\" sex, but some pretty hot but ultimately mutually consensual and regular sex.\n\nAs we're done with that, she's kinda quipping about how I get horny when we have to make it somewhere, and I'm like don't worry, it's no big deal, take as much time as you need and don't rush, I'll let the friend know we're late and say it's my fault, they'll start without us and that's that. She's like - ok sure, and goes to keep getting ready. At that point we still have about 50 mins left until the arranged time, but I assumed she'd need longer so I immediately call in that we'll be late.\n\nNow comes the plot twist - another friend Y is also late and so he's offering to drive us there. I tell my gf that, but minding not to put any pressure on her, I'm like - hey, Y can drive us, he'll also be late so we can basically tell him to come whenever, or we can just tell him to go alone. She's like okay yeah thats good, and she gives me a time by which she'll be done for sure, I let Y know and that's that.\n\nHowever, as that time is approaching, she starts getting more and more frustrated and pissed. She spends like 30 minutes trying to get her hair to look exactly the way she wants her to - like tying it, saying she looks r-word and hideous, letting it all down and retying it again, over and over. And I'm next to her, reassuring her, saying I think it really looks nice (honestly), even taking pics from different angles to show her it really looks fine and she's overthinking it. But she's just getting more mad, starts yelling how it's all my fault, I fucked up her timing, she'll lose the desire to have sex with me in the future because of this, it's the last time she's going somewhere with me, she even threw her armband at the floor at one point, how frustrated she was. All the while I'm trying to calm her down but am also flabbergasted at what's happening.\n\nAt some point we finally leave, the Y friend waited a couple minutes extra for us but he smoked a cig and said its no biggie. The boardgame evening itself went great.\n\nAfterwards, we come back, and I'm really feeling off about the whole thing. She asks me if I'm pissed, I say not exactly pissed but not feeling the happiest, but then she asks me \"is it because of what I said to X\" (something random she said during the evening), and I'm like, hell no, it's because of the entire meltdown you had on me because I dared to be horny for you?\n\nWe ended up arguing, I made it very clear I find her reaction unacceptable and I felt awful about that, while her reasoning boiled down to \"oh so now I can't be frustrated about a valid reason\", and how I should basically learn to keep it in my pants when the timing isn't right.\n\nWe kinda left it at that, and talked normally a bit after, but then I went to the room to sit on my PC and decompress a bit. About 15 minutes later I come back, see her studying, ask her something but she ignores me and doesn't respond.

Looking back on it now maybe she reminded me of Jake in some subconscious way. But we became fast friends. One night I invited her over to make a dish for a potluck at work, since we both loved since we both like to cook/bake. While we were there, Jake came home and I introduced them and he sat with us while we worked. \n\nThey clicked instantly. They’re not similar in terms of interests, but they have the same sense of humour and the same kind of energy? Idk how to describe it. It was like two puzzle pieces slotting together. And I liked that at first. I didn’t see it then how I see it now. \n\nThe closer I’ve got with Stephanie (because I really do like her) the more she’s integrated into our shared friend group, and the more I have noticed how Jake is around her. I’ve got to say, it’s not inappropriate. It’s more things you can’t control or even notice. He blushes around her constantly. When she says something funny he does this hoarse laugh that I’ve never heard him do before. Sometimes he will see something while we’re out and say I should “tell my friend Stephanie about it”. If someone brings her up, he remembers insane things about her, like her favourite brand of vodka. He talks to her in a tone of voice that’s similar to how he talks to his mom, like just gentle. \n\nHe doesn’t talk to her one on one, or even follow her on socials. I have zero worries about him cheating. But when I see them together, it freaks me out how they seek to gravitate to each other in group settings. How he goes out of his way to explain things to her in detail. How she asks him questions that always seem to get him to open up in a way he didn’t with me for years (and even now I have to tell him explicitly that I want him to be emotional before he does). They just seem to “get” each other. The way he acts with her is a way I didn’t even know he could act. For his birthday, I was stumped for a gift, and I asked Stephanie for suggestions. She picked the perfect thing, I’d never seen Jake as happy as when he opened it. He said he couldn’t believe I’d thought of it and looked at me like he’d never felt as understood by me as he did then. But I didn’t think of it. She did. \n\nI feel like I’m going crazy. Because nothing I can see is concrete - it’s not like he’s super close with her, or she’s asking about him. There’s boundaries. And then there’s just me noticing vibes. But it’s so real, I just know it. I don’t even know if he knows it, or she does. But knowing both of them, sometimes they say something and I know it’s something the other one would want to hear. \n\nI need to let this go. I can’t bring this up to either of them, but it’s consuming me. I’m getting short and depressed every time I say something to Jake and he doesn’t immediately light up. Every time Stephanie asks how my weekend or date night went, it’s like I don’t want to tell her, like I’m hoarding my relationship. I love Jake, and I like Stephanie. I don’t want this to affect my relationships with either of them or even their friendliness with each other.

I said that being stuck in total indecision wasn’t fair to either of us.

She admitted she felt really guilty even thinking about abortion if the baby had Down syndrome and that it made her feel like a terrible person. At the same time, she was scared to keep going without knowing for sure, especially because getting more testing could push things later into the pregnancy.\n\nAfter a long, really hard conversation, she decided she wanted diagnostic testing. Because of the timing, her doctor referred her for an urgent amniocentesis, but it still didn’t happen until about a week later.\n\nWe’re still waiting on the full results, which will probably take y least another week, but we got some of the initial results back yesterday, and the amniocentesis is positive for Down syndrome.\n\nBefore the test, she talked like she’d probably get an abortion if it was confirmed. Now that it actually is, she’s saying she can’t do it. She says it feels wrong to her and that she wouldn’t be able to live with herself if she ended the pregnancy because of this.\n\nI’m honestly not handling this well.

I tried talking to him multiple times, but he brushes it off and tells me that there’s nothing to worry about because it’s safe where he lives. A few days ago, I came across a community specific to his area on Reddit and after going into the rabbit hole, it seems like there’s so much of the same things going on there too. I tried talking to him about it, but he told me that he has a lot of diverse friends and none of them have been affected. He says he understands my concerns but thinks it’s mostly a media narrative and he got annoyed when I wouldn’t let it go. He said that I’m shoving my opinion down his throat when he’s the one who’s actually living there and has more of an idea while I’ve never been in the country and am only reading about it. He said he’s trying to be understanding and if I didn’t want to move there, I should just say that and not talk about all of this. He told me that we can go elsewhere, but he has to uproot his entire life to do that, so he’ll need time.

He didn’t take it very well, but it might just be an initial reaction, so I’ve told him to take some time to think about it. Since it’s a major decision, I think we might have to rethink our relationship. I, for one, don’t want to live in fear for god knows how long and I don’t want him to be forced into doing something he doesn’t want or agree with, for me.

We‘ve had trips to a third country and he’s visited me before, but our trips last from two weeks to a month each time. Also, he definitely isn’t MAGA.

With Christmas just gone I was really struggling on what to get him. I tried asking him multiple times and he kept telling me “oh I don’t care” and then I told him no please just tell me something to get you because I don’t want you to hate it. \n\nIn the past I have bought him an Apple Watch that he ended up not liking which I had to use as my own watch instead as I wasn’t able to get my money back for it. I have tried to be more cautious about making the same mistake. But today I completely failed again. \n\nI have been working a lot lately and only had one day off last week. I had asked him multiple times leading into my day off that can he please tell me what he wants as a gift. He kept telling me he’d get back to me but he never did. On my day off I was frustrated and annoyed. I was with my friend and spent about 4 hours going through every store at the shopping centre hoping to find at least one thing to get him. \n\nI went into a store that was selling the ninja swirl  by creami that was on special. This really seemed to me something my boyfriend might like as he loved ice cream and sorbet. I thought it would be cool as he could experiment and make different flavours that you can’t get at the store. There was also like a bunch of protein options and dairy free that I thought he could find interesting as he expressed intention to eat healthier but still enjoy sweets. \n\nI also was thinking about how it’s a good gift that he could share with his family and with the soft serve feature I thought it would be fun to use. Granted it was an expensive machine for $477 AUD but I thought two years anniversary was something worth celebrating. Plus I had a $300 gift card that was literally collecting dust that I hadn’t used that I wanted to just get rid of. So really only $177 of my own money. \n\nI talked it through with my friend and decided to get it as it was literally 30 minutes until closing time and I had tried every other option. I felt confident in my decision. \n\nLater that night before I was going to sleep my boyfriend sent me a message saying “oh here’s a shirt you could get me for our anniversary.”. This really annoyed me as he knew that I didn’t have another day off before our anniversary and that I wouldn’t be able to leave my job to get anything or get it after work as the store was far away from my house and workplace. \n\nI told him I had already gotten him a gift and that he should have sent it earlier. Regardless I was still confident in my decision. \n\nFast forward to today I had wrapped it up and given it to him. At first he acted really excited and interested. He did ask me how much it was and I had told him not to worry about the cost. But he pressed me so I had told him exactly how much it was but that I had brought it with gift cards. He still\n\nSmiled and said he liked it. It wasn’t until later in the day when he was going home that I started to get the impression he didn’t like it. He said that he was going to leave it at my house and I said no it’s your gift take it home. Then he said oh no I want to make it with you the first time we can do it later. And I said well no take it home we can make it at your house. Then he said no he wants to leave it here. I said to him oh well can you just let my mum know why it’s here then because she made it clear to me that she didn’t want it to live here. \n\nThen he just completely blew up at me and asked me why on earth would I buy this thing and that it was too much money. That he was never going to use it and that I should never of bought it. I started to cry as I was shocked from the sudden switch up and then he started to taunt me almost by saying oh now I’m the bad guy for telling the truth. “This is exactly like that stupid Apple Watch” and then he reminded me that he asked me to buy him a shirt not an ice cream maker. Then he told me I never listen to him and that I am bad with money and make impulsive decisions. \n\nI wanted to argue back and stand up for myself but I knew it would just escalate things further and I was devastated as it’s literally our anniversary and he’s blowing up at me for buying him this gift I generally thought he’d like. I also didn’t really know how to respond. I mean I feel like a complete failure. A bad girlfriend. Clearly I don’t know him at all as I thought he would love this gift. \n\nAll I said to him was that I could return it and get store credit. And that I was sorry. But this only made him mad saying I was trying to make him look bad. He then told me that he was doing me a favour by telling me now he hates it and that I couldn’t get mad at him in a months time for never using it \n\n \n\nWhilst he was going off at me my mum was in the other room. I knew she could hear us so i asked him to lower his voice down. He then got frustrated and said he had to go and I just said ok no worries. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. After he left my mum came and checked on me if I was ok. I just cried to her and she acknowledged she had heard what he had said and noted he was acting like a prick. She told me you don’t do that to someone if you don’t like a gift. You don’t say it to them on the day like that.

There was been a notable change in her strength and I was happy for her as she seemed really proud of herself.

I thought that was fair enough and I’d leave it and let her lead the pace when she was ready to again.\n\nWell this weekend she told me that she has developed a very intense crush on her PT and that while she knows crushes happen in relationships this feels like it’s more. She said she finds herself constantly seeking his attention either at the gym or on social media. She has started tagging him in all her posts but I just assumed it was more of a giving credit thing. Then she admitted she has started wearing less and less at the gym to get his attention which is something I hadn’t noticed as she always takes a gym bag with her and gets changed there.\n\nShe admitted that the last few times we had sex she fantasised that it was him and that’s why she stopped having sex as she felt too guilty. Probably the worst thing she told me was that a few days ago she saw him having a personal session with someone else, a younger woman more his age, and she saw them laughing together and she got that jealous and upset she had to leave the gym and go cry in her car.\n\nShe said he has done nothing to encourage this and has been nothing but professional through out all this and he is not at fault.\n\nI don’t know what to do I’m crushed. Do I just sit back and wait for the crush to stop? Do I demand she changes gym and blocks this guy?

By accident i came across some chats between her and her husband. I wish i hadn’t because what i read has left me deeply disturbed.\n\nThey had an arranged marriage. He had been in love with someone else before marriage but couldn’t marry her due to family pressure. Since marriage he has repeatedly insulted my sister her height, her family background, her worth as a person. He keeps telling her he has a government job and she is “nothing,” even though she is well educated.\n\nFor context: we are not a wealthy family but neither is he from some privileged or “royal” background. His father works for someone else and his brothers do too. At least my father works independently. Yet he constantly uses money, status, and his job to demean my sister and make her feel inferior. This feels less about reality and more about control and ego.\n\nThey currently live in a joint family. He has told her that at least in the joint family he can see his parents and siblings but once they move into their own house he doesn’t know how he will tolerate living with “just her.” In moments of anger he has even told her to either end her life or divorce him.\n\nThey have two very young daughters (one is 3+, the other 1+). He has shown clear resentment over having daughters and was unhappy during both pregnancies. Early in the marriage he also cheated on her she found out and still stayed.\n\nWhat hurts me most is that in the chats my sister wasn’t arguing back. She was just agreeing, apologising, trying to calm him down.\n\nAnother complication is that i am her youngest sibling. When i try to raise concerns she shuts down, gets defensive, or says he was “just joking” and that i’m overthinking. Because of the age and family dynamic i don’t have the space to confront her directly even though i’m extremely worried about her mental health and self worth.\n\nI’m struggling with:\n\n•How to support her without making things worse?\n\n•Whether this clearly counts as emotional abuse?\n\n•How to help her see that this is not normal or acceptable?\n\n•What role family should realistically play especially when children are involved?\n\nI’m not asking whether i should confront her husband i know that could backfire on her. I’m looking for advice on how to quietly support my sister, protect her dignity, and help her move toward safety and self respect in a way that makes sense in the indian context.\n\nAny practical advice would really help.", "author": "redditorsinceages", "score": 1204, "num_comments": 83, "created_utc": 1769686072.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qq62o3/i_accidentally_read_my_sistersf29_chats_with_her/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qq62o3/i_accidentally_read_my_sistersf29_chats_with_her/"}, {"id": "1r0wmh4", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "American F/42 my husband is Ghanaian M/46. I’m having a hard time accepting my husband doesn’t want me to cook for him", "selftext": "I’m an American F/42 my husband is Ghanaian M/46. We dated for 3 years been married for 2. My husband likes to cook and is a good cook. He likes his local food and rarely eats at restaurants or fast food. He’d rather wait until he gets home to have his local food. When he cooks it’s not only for himself but for me and anyone else in the house that would like to eat it. It’s important to him that we eat together so when he cooks he makes my plate and we eat. Even if I’m not feeling particularly hungry I still sit with him and eat.\n\nMy husband is a truck driver so he makes his local food to last while he’s out. When he comes home he’s hungry for fresh cooked local food. I’d like to prepare his traditional dishes but he rejects the offer and says he’ll do it. I know he wants to come home to a cooked meal, he’s said as much plenty of times, but he literally won’t eat it if I cook it. I don’t want to waste food, which I’ve done, by cooking his food only for him to not eat it, it’s not because it doesn’t taste right but because he doesn’t have a “taste for it”. The thing is I’m a good cook and I have experience cooking food from different cultures and his so it’s not like I can’t handle the challenge. Before I got pregnant with our son I made some of his foods that he began to request, even told me they’re better than his. He would go back for seconds and eat leftovers so I started sending him out on the truck with the food I cooked. After I got far along in pregnancy he didn’t want me to cook for him because of my condition when he could cook for himself, I was grateful for that. Now our baby is 5 months old and I’m ready to cook elaborate meals again but he wants none of it.\n\nHe told me when I go to Ghana and learn from his people then I can cook for him because it’s too complicated, WTH? When he’s really hungry and doesn’t feel like cooking he’ll drive about an hour away to eat food his friend’s Ghanaian wife cooks, this hurts and it doesn’t make sense to me. When I asked him what’s the difference if I cook it and it tastes right he says she’s Ghanaian so she knows how to cook it. When I ask him what’s the difference from me going on YouTube and learning from those Ghanaian women how to cook the food if it’s prepared properly to me learning from his people, he says the food is too complicated.\n\nHe told me to stick to cooking my foods (which he won’t eat because it’s not Ghanaian) and he’ll cook his food and I can join him if I want to. So the other night I did as he suggested, I cooked and chose not to eat his food because I really like what I cooked but then he got annoyed when I didn’t eat his food with him. Sometimes for breakfast he’ll ask for me to cook a specific thing but this is starting to make me feel like a servant waiting on an order instead of lovingly cooking for my husband which is what I would enjoy doing. This is not what we discussed before we got married and it’s not what our dating life was like. I think I would be ok with adjusting to this new dynamic if he didn’t make comments about him being tired of cooking and how he can’t wait for me to cook his food after go learn from his people. This feels like a no win situation to me. Frankly I don’t know if I can adjust to this.\n\nI actually enjoy taking care of those I love around me and cooking is one of those things. It feels like an important part (to me) of our marriage took a hit after an argument about this yesterday when he again insisted I don’t cook for him, I guess it finally sunk in that he’s not going to change his mind. I’m hurt, angry, and disillusioned.\n\n**I shared an update here:**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/s/kz2DNXnpl5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/kz2DNXnpl5)\n\n**Thank you everyone**", "author": "Livid-Ad5237", "score": 1160, "num_comments": 328, "created_utc": 1770717057.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r0wmh4/american_f42_my_husband_is_ghanaian_m46_im_having/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r0wmh4/american_f42_my_husband_is_ghanaian_m46_im_having/"}, {"id": "1qi53sp", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "Am I (36F) horrible for saying I'd leave my partner (37M)?", "selftext": "Nine months ago my (36F) husband (37M) told me that he thinks he would be much happier living as a woman.

I know it must be hell in his head, and I feel deeply sorry for him, but no. \n\nThis was very much the wrong thing to say. My partner has had depression for a while, after a sports injury left him with a lifelong disability. But it's been so much worse. I've been the one responsible for supporting him with depression for as long as he's had it. It's medicated, but he relies on me for so much emotional validation. It's exhausting. And the last nine mile months have been hell. I don't know what I'm coming home to everyday, what he'll be like. It feels like he hates me, like I'm being punished. There's no shouting, but I grew up with an emotionally unstable mother and it's like that all over again. \n\nWe have two children (7F) (5M) and for as long as we've had them, I've been the primary care giver and in charge of everything.

I couldn’t bring myself to reply, but I read everything. Your kindness and perspectives meant more to me than I can put into words.\n\nTrigger warning: mentions of physical abuse.\n\nSince my last post, things haven’t settled. They’ve escalated.\n\nAfter I brought up wanting a child again, my husband became distant and offended, and we stopped really talking. Around that time, my brother visited us from abroad. We tried to act like everything was fine, but it clearly wasn’t. He noticed immediately.\n\nLater, my brother told me my father had also sensed something was wrong and had asked him to help us either talk things through properly or decide whether the marriage could continue. This matters because last year there was a violent incident, after which I went to the police for protection and my husband had to stay away for 14 days. During that time, he admitted he had been talking and flirting with a female colleague because he was upset and needed someone to talk to.\n\nWhile my brother was still visiting, I asked my husband to seriously talk about where we were heading. I suggested talking just the two of us, involving a mediator, or even discussing separation. He said he didn’t need help.\n\nAfter my brother left, he avoided the topic completely. I suggested we go out to dinner to talk, hoping neutral ground would help. The dinner started off well. We laughed. It felt normal for a moment. Then I asked him directly if he wanted a baby.\n\nInstead of answering, he questioned whether I was stable enough to be a mother, criticized my forgetfulness, and judged what kind of parent I’d be. I stopped him and said I wasn’t asking to be evaluated. I just needed an honest answer.\n\nHe said we were already having unprotected sex. I told him clearly that I would never bring a child into the world with someone who doesn’t want to be a father. I said I’d rather choose a sperm bank than force someone into parenthood. That offended him deeply. He said he feels more like a big brother than a father to his existing daughter and accused me of caring more about a hypothetical baby than about him. After that, we avoided each other.\n\nA few days later, he borrowed my car for work in another city and was supposed to be home around 6 pm. By 8 pm, he wasn’t answering calls or messages. I checked the car’s location and saw it parked somewhere else entirely. I panicked. After over an hour of trying to reach him, I triggered the car alarm. Only then did he drive home.\n\nI was furious and hurt. He refused to explain. Something broke in me, and I told him I wanted a divorce and that he should move out by the end of the month. He agreed and went to the spare room.\n\nLater, I confronted him again and asked who he had been with. He claimed he was alone. When I pressed for honesty, he said he was ashamed of me and threatened to leave if I didn’t stop talking. He left the apartment and came back about an hour later.\n\nThe next day, I tried to talk calmly, not to fix things but to end them respectfully. He then admitted he had been with a female colleague, sitting in the car and talking. He insists nothing physical happened and doesn’t see it as cheating. When I asked when his feelings toward me changed, he said it was when I went to the police last year.\n\nWe both cried. I told him love doesn’t have to turn into hate, even when it ends. He told me he’s deliberately giving me reasons to hate him because it makes it easier for him to leave.\n\nI went for a long walk with my dog afterward to clear my head.\n\nRight now, I’m all over the place emotionally. Sometimes I’m practical and thinking about logistics. Other times I want to run back and say I want him no matter what. Then the anger and grief return. I’m grieving not just the marriage, but the future I thought we were building.\n\nFrom an outside perspective, what patterns stand out here, and what would you prioritize if you were in my position?", "author": "Sss0814", "score": 1013, "num_comments": 371, "created_utc": 1770589152.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qzmpu6/update_my_34f_husband_35m_now_says_he_doesnt_want/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qzmpu6/update_my_34f_husband_35m_now_says_he_doesnt_want/"}, {"id": "1qksbok", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "My (25M) girlfriend (25F) just dropped a bomb on me saying her stepfather has been sexually harassing her and borderline r*ping her for 13 years up till 2 years ago.

She didn’t even ask if there was anything I’d prefer to watch on TV😂\n\nWe literally did nothing all day until around 9pm when I asked “what’re we going to do for dinner?”, and she said “idk we don’t have any groceries” & I just went to bed lol. \n\nI don’t really know how to put my feelings into words other than just saying I feel so sad, like I’m not worth any effort or time, and I can’t stop thinking about it. It feels like I love and care so incredibly much about her and making her feel loved and cared about, and she physically couldn’t care less about how I feel. \n\nIs this worth trying to talk through?

It was a video of a girl at a Bad Bunny concert (I’m a fan of his), and the caption said something like *“I shaved my entire body just in case.”* I honestly thought it was funny and liked it without thinking much of it. There was no intention behind it ..I wasn’t trying to be inappropriate.\n\nWhen he brought it up, I understood why it made him uncomfortable and I apologized right away.\n\nFor the first few days after, he barely spoke to me and we stayed in separate rooms most of the day. Three days later, I tried to bring it up calmly to talk it through, but the argument actually got worse.\n\nDuring that fight, I brought up what felt like double standards. A few months ago, he had sent a picture of t\\*ts in a group chat with his friends and then told me he wont stop doing it cause its only a boys chat but he'll ensure that I'm not around, which really bothered me at the time but I eventually chose to forgive and move on. When I mentioned this, he said I can’t compare the two situations and got very angry that I brought it up. (I hate bringing up past situations but again it's hard not too)\n\nHe then told me our relationship is now “damaged,” that he can never look at me the same, and that I’m basically not trustworthy anymore.. all over liking that Instagram post.\n\nSince then, he’s completely shut me out again. We barely talk, stay in separate rooms all day, and when I try small gestures like ordering food for us, he’ll grab it without saying thank you and go back into his office.\n\nI understand that liking the post upset him, and I owned that and apologized. But a full week of silence, being told the relationship is damaged, and being treated coldly feels extreme to me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Lets just say I did not bring up the boob story here on reddit\\*\\*\\* did I fuck up really bad with the post?\n\nAt this point I’m starting to wonder if this is unhealthy or even emotional manipulation.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this?\n\nIs this kind of reaction normal, or does this sound excessive/unhealthy?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!\n\n**Feb 2, 2026** – Hey everyone!

My (F30) boyfriend (M27) and I both work at the same company. We’ve been together for 2 years. We are both engineers in comparable roles, except I’ve been there 6 years and he’s been there 3.5.\n\nAbout my side: After getting 5/5 stars on all reviews for the last 5 years, I had a leadership change that took away my chances of promotion. The lead is a person that is very known to push people under the bus to get ahead, so I was forced to move to another team with a great lead but less growth opportunity. I tried to talk to my partner a few times about how frustrating this was because I was missing out on an opportunity I was pretty guaranteed otherwise. Not only did he brush me off, he started playing devils advocate immediately, going as far as openly questioning if I was deserving of a promotion in the first place. He actually called me entitled. He and I don’t work together and he has no frame of reference for what I do. His reviews in comparison are generally 3/5. As engineers we do similar enough work that I know that our time, energy, and complexity of projects is very comparable.\n\nToday he just called me and told me that he got promoted into the same position that I was supposed to get, (but different org) and told me he wanted to go celebrate with me. He’s been at the company for half the amount of time I have, and in the same position is now making over 30% more than I am. I’m seriously happy for him, but at no point did he think that I might be upset.\n\nI’m not jealous, really, I’m upset by the lack of empathy on his part for either situation. The vibe I’m getting is that when he gets it it’s deserved, but when I don’t get it it’s because I’m not good enough. This lack of empathy exists all over in our relationship.\n\nNot sure if this matters, but more context for us ladies: my company has about 6% women in the engineering portion, and I don’t know a single one that has gotten a promotion without having to fight for it or threaten to leave. I speak up for myself at like a man would when asking for raises, etc. The lead that I was put under is known for being condescending, especially towards women. I tried to tell my partner this but he brushed me off like I was making an excuse.\n\nQuestion: How do I be supportive but also let him know that I deserve to be supported? I don’t want to take away his excitement, but I feel like he didn’t see or hear me at all when I voiced my frustrations. Would really like some advice on how to handle the situation.\n\nI feel like an asshole girlfriend, which is why I’m asking here and not talking to him about it.\n\nEdit: grammar", "author": "Expensive_Ad_4350", "score": 843, "num_comments": 147, "created_utc": 1770347597.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qx6bwp/partner_m27_got_a_promotion_at_the_same_company_i/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qx6bwp/partner_m27_got_a_promotion_at_the_same_company_i/"}, {"id": "1r1dde4", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "My (35f) husband (35m) asked me to stop reading romance novels", "selftext": "My husband (35m) of 11 years asked me (35f) to stop reading romance novels. He said that he doesn't like that he’s not the one turning me on. He hasn't said this in so many words, but essentially, he thinks it's cheating. The thing is, he was just diagnosed with a porn addiction. \n\nHe has had erectile dysfunction due to his overconsumption of porn and \"gorilla grip\" masterbation technique. He hasn't been able to finish with P in V sex since we got pregnant with our kid 5 years ago. The last year or so, he hasn't even been able to get or stay hard without porn and a tight hand. I had HG when I was pregnant. The one and only time we tried to have sex I vomited on him. We have had very little bedroom time since. I finally convinced him to see the doctor about this issue because he has been so incredibly depressed. He was diagnosed only a week ago and will have his first therapy visit in two weeks.\n\nLast year I started going to a monthly book club. I normally read high fantasy books, but this club is for fantasy romance books. I started going to this book club as my only means of socializing. I have a difficult time maintaining friendships because I have autism only so much energy to spend on people outside of my family. This once monthly book club has been amazing because it's a scheduled two hours. I have loved feeling like I belong and actually contributing to discussions. I look forward to seeing my friends and I really feel like my mental health has improved because of it. Since starting going to this book club my libido has increased steeply. I always turn to my husband, but he is frequenlty unable to provide what I need with his ED. When things don't work out with him, I lose my interest in chasing an orgasm. We both end up feeling rejected and dejected.\n\nToday he asked me to stop reading romance novels altogether. After writing this out, I can see now that he’s likely feeling a lot of pressure from me. I don't want to lose my friendships. I also don't want my husband to feel inadequate or like I don't care about his emotional needs. I'm trying to figure out a reasonable and rational way I can keep my once monthly socializing with these friends while respecting the current needs of my husband. He has not stopped or even slowed down his porn consumption or masterbation. Since his therapy session isn't for two weeks, we don't have anything to go off of for how to help him yet. I'm feeling a little lost on the best course of action for both of us. \n\nWhat do you think is reasonable going forward?\n\nEdit: \nI want to thank everyone for their support!  There are some of the points that I wanted to address. \n\nFirst, he obviously does have hands and a mouth. I just feel immediately turned off if he's not also obviously visibly enthusiastic about performing those activities. Also, at the risk of sounding too vulgar, I usually end up with a yeast or BV infection after he uses his mouth or hands, so I avoid it.\n\nSecond, we are both trying to navigate things right now. He started meds for depression and wasn't given any direction on how to stop these problematic activities. He tried to stop the first few days, but he literally stayed awake for 40 hours. It's consuming him. I honestly feel like this isn’t just a \"behavioral addiction.\" He needs support, love and acceptance. I'm not going to lie and say I'm not pissed off and hurt by it, but people who aren't in this situation can't truly appreciate the nuances to this kind of addiction. I'm not going to up and leave him. We are a family and I'm going to exhaust all our options before leaving. \n\nLast, I like the rational people with practical advice. I put some boundaries down. I told him that I will be continuing to read one book a month and I will be attending the book club. I will not initiate sex again until such a time that we ALL (him, me, therapist) feel he is comfortable having healthy sex again. I won't hide what I'm doing. I'm doing something healthy for me and I shouldn't suffer for it. He was naturally pretty upset to hear this. I think you guys are right and that he’s projecting. Trying to grasp some control in the situation by making us equal in his eyes. I was too deep in it to see what was rational. Now that I can see it, I'm not budging. Luckily, I have the autism to help me with that.\n\nThank you for helping me see what's healthy!\n\n", "author": "anon_y_m0use", "score": 839, "num_comments": 578, "created_utc": 1770757962.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r1dde4/my_35f_husband_35m_asked_me_to_stop_reading/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r1dde4/my_35f_husband_35m_asked_me_to_stop_reading/"}, {"id": "1qfizoy", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "I (30F) have told my husband (41M) that I want a divorce and he’s ignoring it", "selftext": "For context, we’ve been married for close to 6 years and have two children (10 and 2) and own a home together. I’ve always been quite organised, I like a routine and things to be done or planned. My husband is much more mellow, and for years I thought it was a healthy balance. However, especially since we had our youngest, I’ve been feeling more and more emotionally unfulfilled by him. He’s not done anything “divorceable” in and of itself, but the cycle of my handling all the domestic, financial and parenting responsibilities has gone too far. I’ve asked him a thousand times to step up and help more and he says “I’ll do more” and does an evening of washing up before reverting to normal. I finally snapped after I spent my day off (I work full time) sorting through his IMMENSE pile of dirty laundry (there were legit covid masks around 3/4 way down, so I’m guessing it’s at least 5 years worth of shit he hasn’t managed to bring down for me to wash). If you want to understand how it got so bad, this was the hill I decided some time ago to die on - I asked him repeatedly to bring down the laundry as I do all of it, and I wanted him to take responsibility. It turns out he’s just been buying new clothes when he has nothing clean, which means there is 0 storage now it’s all been laundered, which I raised to him. He just said “I’m sure you’ll find somewhere to put it” and I lost it. I told him how lonely it is being his partner. How I do all the work, I pay the bills, I sort the childcare and activities and make sure everyone is ok. I don’t know what I expected, but he said nothing at all. Just stared into the distance. I asked if he had anything to say at all, and he said no. And I told him I don’t want this anymore. I don’t deserve to be so unhappy. I told him I want a divorce.\n\nThis is where I need advice, really. He didn’t respond. He just carried on silently standing there. After about 15 minutes, he left the room and he hasn’t said anything about it since. This was a week ago, and I’ve been polite but nothing more, while he’s been asking about my day and general chatter. I’m so confused. He’s not making an effort for the relationship I wanted when I married him but he’s also not acknowledging that I’ve told him I’m done. I don’t know how to address this further - I don’t have any desire to argue (or to talk to a brick wall about my feelings again!) but it feels like he’s pretending it didn’t happen. How do I move forward?\n\nEDIT: thank you for your responses. I was never looking for permission - I think for me, a decision regarding a relationship is typically a conversation. It helps to be reassured by strangers that I don’t need to wait for that conversation in order to move forward.

Wife's baggage has become too much too handle and I feel anger towards her. How do I move forward?", "selftext": "When I first met my wife we were young, cool, and figuring life out. She didn't know how to cook and I remember she once made me eggs with soo much salt they were physically crunchy. It was cute at the time and I summed it up to growing pains. She had lived with her mother who did everything for her. I had lived on my own for many years at that point and had been self sufficient since moving out of home. She also earned quite a bit less than I did which I did not consider a problem. I thought eventually things would get better but they havent.\n\n\nAlong the way we had a child. 7 years later I am at a breaking point and harbor a lot of anger towards her. She still hasn't figured out basic adult task. I wash and fold her laundry and it piles up until her mom comes over and puts it away. I have genuinely only seen her clean our restroom once in the last two years. She still doesn't know how to cook and takes no interest in learning. She earns <5% of what I do, I don't even add it to our financial tracker as I don't see the money anyways. We have a 1% lifestyle due to my contributions.\n\nOur home is beautiful and she has a lot to do with that but it has also completely depleted our financial resources. We went from 100k of savings to living paycheck to paycheck in two years. I recently brought up our financial situation and her suggestions was to sell my car and share hers. I've already cancelled my health insurance and forego medical care due to limiting resources. \n\nI could probably deal with all of this if she was more patient and emotionally stable but she is far from it. Her mom is an alcoholic and everytime she drinks our household is on pins and needles for a few days. It starts out with her screaming at her mother while being very unkind in her expressions. She typically does this away from my son and I but I often have to make sure I take my son out of the house so he doesn't hear her. Just the act of screaming sends my nervous system into high alert. She changes over the next few days and proceeds to find issues with every little thing. We fought for hours and my son was over an hour late to school this week because I was wearing socks inside the house. \n\nI acknowledge her pain and I have been patiently dealing with this for a long time but I'm tired. She recently noted that I am emotionless when she cries. I am. Genuinely. After dozens of times of the same thing playing out I have become numb to it. \n\nI also acknowledge I am not the most supportive person during her episodes. I feel I am already running close to my limit on a daily basis and her episodes make me angry. She ask for love and compassion but its so difficult when she is spitting venom due her crisis and I bundle that with her lack of contributions around the household. \n\nThis is my only serious relationship and I don't have anyone close to share with but it feels like things should be lighter. She is very pretty and that has given her a lot of privilege in our relationship. \n\nEverytime we have talked about going our separate ways I walk it back. She either starts self harming or has an anxiety crisis. Even if I could get pass that stage, she has nothing. Her salary is nowhere near enough to live alone and she would have to move in with her mother. \n\nShe is in therapy but she always walks away from her sessions sort of blaming me. I don't think her therapist is helping our relationship. I am not abusive, at least not in the general sense. I don't scream, raise my voice, or get physical. I will often retreat into myself where I find comfort and peace. If there is no dialogue there is no conflict. \n\nAre my expectations of a relationship unrealistic?

He’s from a different culture too so I’ve learned how to cook his food and do many things “his way”. My husband works a tech job and goes into office once a week. His job isn’t very demanding and most of the time he is at home and playing video games or watching YouTube or working on projects for his hobbies. We are very well off on his income.\n\nWe made an agreement before getting married that this would be our dynamic but that he would still help me.

Today after I made lunch, I said jokingly “good luck with clean up“ because there was a lot of pots. However, he started getting upset and told me that this is my job and not his. He said he worked so hard his whole life which is why he has the job that he currently has and how it’s not his fault that I have a job as housewife. This was hurtful because he doesn’t really respect women who work and doesn’t take them seriously either. It’s like no matter what I do, I can never earn his respect.

He started saying how I have a pointless degree and never finish anything in life which is why I have the job as a housewife. I felt disrespected and under-appreciated. The argument got really bad to the point where he called me a whore, and that he could get any woman he wants and that any woman would be extremely happy with being his housewife. He called me dead weight and useless. Those words killed me. It really hurt and I’ve been crying for hours now. I did call him an asshole and slammed the doors a couple times. I don’t know how to survive in this dynamic. I tried my best to explain myself and our agreements but he didn’t want to listen and just wanted to fight. He blamed it on me being on my period. He also just said a lot of lies like that he does everything in our home. I know how hard I work though. \n\nMy husband is generally a very good guy especially with my family and his family.

She's my other half atp. We're in the thick of wedding planning.\n\nMy fiancée pretty much has the same friend group from college. I get along with them, but they're mostly her friends. Our most consistent fight is with one particular friend (30M) who I'll call Caleb.\n\nI'm not upset about her having a guy friend. My issue is the lack of boundaries and respect. This dude doesn't know boundaries, nor does he respect our relationship.\n\nHe's always out of pocket, giving lingering hugs or finding some excuse to touch her, and he just hovers. He gifted her jewelry once for her birthday. Even during dates he'll hit up her phone. He looks like a guy who's waiting to come off the bench.\n\nI've expressed my concerns about him. For the most part, my fiancée brushes me off. She'll say I'm being insecure, that he's her oldest friend, and that I should trust her.\n\nRecently, my fiancée and her sister/maid of honor (29F), who I'll call Kat for clarity, had a bad falling out. I only knew some nasty stuff was said, and that Kat had accused her of being a bridezilla and a bad sister. They've fought before, but never anything like this. My fiancée kicked Kat out of the wedding.\n\nThe other day, Kat reached out to me about my fiancée being untruthful. She claims that at the group's New Year's Eve party, my fiancée made out with Caleb at midnight and later left with him.\n\nUsually my fiancée and I spend NYE together, but I couldn't get the time off this year. Apparently Caleb was laying it on thick with my fiancée the entire party, and she entertained his advances.\n\nMy fiancée ignored Kat's attempts at talking her down. She said my fiancée said it was her \"last New Year's before lockdown,\" lockdown referring to being married.\n\nIt was a lot to process. My initial instinct was to shut Kat down. Despite our issues with Caleb, I did trust my fiancée, but I couldn't ignore how much Kat's story matched my doubts.\n\nThat night, we were supposed to FaceTime at midnight, but she was ghost. She was ghost that whole night, and she's been weird ever since. Idk then right after the party, she's been implementing boundaries with Caleb.\n\nKat admitted she initially covered for my fiancée. She pushed her to come clean before the wedding, and that's the real reason they fell out. She felt I deserved the truth. I didn't say much. I was too numb to really feel anything.\n\nI didn't rush to confront my fiancée, but she could tell I was off and kept asking. When I did confront her, she was all over the place. She went into a whole Kat rant, but I told her this was her chance to tell her own story.\n\nShe asked me to promise to hear her out before confessing to flirting and the kiss with Caleb but swore nothing else happened and that she didn't refer to us getting married as lockdown.\n\nI asked her why Kat would tell the truth about her making out with Caleb, which alone thoroughly crossed the line, but lie about everything else.\n\nShe insists Kat's trying to sabotage our relationship and that she's a jealous brat. She said the kiss meant nothing. She was caught up in the moment. I'm the one she wants to be with.\n\nShe promised to do anything to regain my trust, including cutting Caleb fully off. She said we're starting our lives together, we're what matters, and I shouldn't let Kat come between us.\n\nI wasn't receptive to her. We fought, and I told her I needed space to think. Ever since, she's been super affectionate. She still swears she didn't hook up with Caleb and that Kat's sabotaging.\n\nBut I can't ignore what I already know and the possibility of everything else Kat said being true. My world has crashed down. The wedding's all set. It's around the corner.\n\nI feel so numb. I'm in love with my fiancée. She's my best friend, but I'm questioning everything. Idk what to believe anymore. I feel like an idiot.\n\nHow do I move forward with my relationship when I'm lost as hell?\n\nTL;DR My relationship with my fiancée has blown up after her sister accused her of cheating with her close guy friend on New Year's Eve. My fiancée confessed to kissing him but denies everything else. She swears her sister's trying to sabotage our relationship. We fought, and I told her I needed space to think. Ever since, she's been super affectionate. Our wedding's around the corner, and now this mess. I'm questioning everything. Idk what to believe anymore.

During it, she got off the phone with her brother, who she had called to vent about what we were discussing.\n\nFor context, I’ve always felt my girlfriend and her brother don’t have the healthiest emotional dynamic. There’s a typical older sister/younger brother thing going on, and he tends to be closed off and indirect. At family gatherings he’s distant, and I’ve noticed he often doesn’t fully express how he actually feels.\n\nWhen she told me what her brother said, I told her I didn’t think he was telling the full story and that with him, you often have to read between the lines — tone, phrasing, what’s left unsaid. She immediately got frustrated and said I was “trying to prove a point again,” and that I was invalidating what her brother had literally just told her. \n\nShe then said, “You can call him if you want.” At first, I said it probably wouldn’t change anything because he isn’t very emotionally in tune. But after some back and forth, I agreed to call him — with her listening to the conversation. To be clear, she wasn’t secretly listening or anything like that. She was on my laptop next to me while I called him on my phone and listened the whole time.\n\nDuring the call, her brother actually opened up more to me and added a lot of context and detail that he hadn’t shared with her. In that moment, my girlfriend acknowledged that I was right and that he had been holding things back.\n\nA day or two later, though, she told me she didn’t like how I handled it. She said it was unnecessary and felt like I had her listen in just to prove my point. That’s where I got confused. I explained that my intention wasn’t to prove anything — it was to help her see what I was seeing and, honestly, to feel believed and trusted.\n\nMy biggest question to her was: how was it unnecessary if she didn’t believe me in the first place? If I hadn’t done that, what was the alternative?\n\nI even asked her afterward: “If I had talked to your brother one-on-one and then told you what he said, would you believe me?” She said no. So I asked, “Then how would you want me to go about this in a way that doesn’t feel like I’m proving a point, but still allows you to trust what I’m saying?” Her answer was basically, “I don’t know — maybe we’d have to agree to disagree.”\n\nThat’s where I’m stuck. I don’t understand how I’m supposed to “agree to disagree” when it feels like my intentions or character are being questioned — like I’m being accused of trying to prove something when I genuinely felt I was trying to communicate and be understood.\n\nI’m not trying to win arguments. I’m trying to be trusted.\n\nBut now I’m wondering if I handled this wrong, or if there’s a deeper issue around trust and communication here.\n\nAm I missing something? Was there a better way to handle this that I’m not seeing?", "author": "Mountain_Effect", "score": 774, "num_comments": 64, "created_utc": 1770767992.0, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r1hnom/24m_23f_had_my_girlfriend_listen_to_a_call/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r1hnom/24m_23f_had_my_girlfriend_listen_to_a_call/"}, {"id": "1qhqyv9", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "Wife (29F) keeps booking red eye flights and I (32M) keep getting judged for not driving her.", "selftext": "EDIT: As I mention, but some seem to miss, this is through work, yes, but it's not paid for by work. It's a government job and the administration has cut all travel budgets, so she has to pay her own travel since it's optional events. \n\nAnd she's not complaining to her friends. I'm there when the convo happen. It's casual. Just friends asking what she did last week type of convo. \n\n**Also, yes, \"red eye\" seems to have been the wrong term.**\n\n................................... \n\nOriginal post:\n\nThe cheapest flights are at 5am. So she books those. That's her choice. I tell her she's welcome to book mid day flights, but prefers the cheaper flights.\n\nShe's asked me before if I could drive her, but of course I told her I simply can't do that and ruin my sleep for the next day of work. \n\nWe also live next to a public transport rail that goes from our home, to the airport, with no transfers. When she opts for this, I take her every time (2 minute drive). \n\nShe doesn't particularly mind me not driving her, that's not really the issue. \n\nThe issue is all her friends are starting to really get pushy about it. Almost not a single outting goes by where someone doesn't make a quip about me not doing \"husband duties\" and driving her to and from the airport. \n\nI wouldn't say this is starting to influence her, but I worry it would. Plus I don't really like her friends judging me like this.\n\nI feel uncomfortable asking her to tell her friends off. Hard to explain but it just doesn't feel right. \n\nWhat would you do in this situation? Would a good husband just drive her to the airport when she needs it? \n\nFor clairty:\n\nThis is all for work. It's optional, but she likes going to see her coworkers in person for events. Some years there is 1 event. Some years it's 1 event every month. \n\nDrive time to airport - 40 minutes 1 way (I'd have to do both directions obviously for 80 minutes) \n\nRail system to airport - 55 minutes \n\nUber to airport - $80 if this is even an option at such hours.

We split rent for awhile until she wanted to finish school which then I agreed upon to pay rent and utilities until she graduates which took 2 years. To my understanding after she graduated and got a job then she would help with bills so I can build a savings and pay off debt. That hasn’t been the case at all since she graduated last May. For the past year she has stated that if she splits rent then she is a “roommate” and this past December I brought the topic up again and she brought up marriage. Our relationship has been rocky these past few months. But honestly I’ve just been extremely stressed between work and our bills that it hasn’t helped our relationship at all. I guess I’m just looking for advice on this. Because I know social media and some cultures believes the man should handle all the bills. But I’ve always wanted for this relationship to feel like a team. Where we both make goals for what we want and how we will get there.

Accidents happen. You had a big life changing event occur and are focused on you and your baby, as you should be. \n\nHowever, joking about paying for the clean up was likely poorly received, even if it is something you intend to pay for. Your friend has a stressful event assisting you and now has the stressful job of fixing the car.\n\nAs others have outlined, it is a biohazard job. This could easily run thousands of dollars depending on the extent of the damage. This is not a job most detailers will take and those that do charge a premium. So your friend has to find someone to clean the car and figure out a way to get the car there as it likely isn't safe to drive.\n\nThe car could be totaled. Insurance should cover it, but insurance claims usually result in a premium increase which means your friend will feel the effects long after the car is cleaned. If the car is totaled, they now have to go car shopping. If the car was paid off, they may not get enough to fully cover a new car and will now have to budget for a car payment. \n\nThen there is also the question of do they have another car? How will they get to work or run necessary errands if they only have one car? You are offering to pay for the detailing, but if they only have one car, they will have to pay for a rental or be without a car.\n\nPlus it was her husband's car. My husband cherishes his car. He has spent a lot of time and effort to make it the way he likes it. If something similar happened in his car, I know my husband would understand but he would also be devastated that his car is ruined and that insurance will not cover all the additional things he did to his car.\n\nThese are all things that could occur with a regular accident, but even then it can damage a relationship when someone close is responsible for the accident. In the moment there was nothing you could do to prevent what happened, but you did heap a lot of stress onto someone else. \n\nSounds like there could be additional factors worsening the situation, but I cannot comment on those. \n\nHowever, you should give your friend some space, you should take the advice of others and send a check for a realistic amount for a biohazard clean, and not make jokes until you ascertain that the other person will actually think it is funny\n\nAlso, all of these things are things your spouse can be assisting on.

Most of all, my children respected me. \n\nTen years later…I got remarried this past year to the most wonderful, caring and beautiful woman after dating for around six amazing years.

Just that is a betrayal of basic marital trust. Grief is not a group discussion topic, especially not with someone who has shown you hostility, and especially not on speakerphone in your own home.\n\nYour husband’s doubling down is the issue. A decent partner would consider you upon discussion of “that hurt me”.  He responded with defensiveness, minimization, and emotional manipulation by saying, “So the marriage is over?”  That’s some deflection if I’ve ever heard it!\n\nThe sexual grabbing afterward is not a separate issue in my opinion, either. That fits the mold. When he felt challenged emotionally, he reasserted physically. You said no. He sulked. That’s straight disrespect. I don’t doubt you for feeling unsafe. Emotional safety is built on discretion, empathy, and repair. He’s offering absolutely none of those. In all honestly, it’s not even about his brother. It’s about your husband who refuses accountability and treats you with contempt. If he wanted to be with you in a meaningful way your pain would mean more than his defensiveness.

Knowing that your neighbors, friends, family had a direct hand in the kidnapping, death, incarceration of others including 13 yrs old kids is terrifying. So her actions might have their origin on her lived experiences, or I could be wrong.\n\n\nI don't justify your mom's actions, however I believe that there's a possibility that her behavior comes from that time in her life.

I'd say you have some level of homophobia \"gay men know how to renovate a house\" is certainly a statement. This is a very mild form of homophobia, but it's one I recommend you check. That's a very stereotypical thing to say. \n\n2. Your husband isn't \"becoming\" homophobic. He is homophobic, and you have only just now noticed it. You broadly sound straight so I'm going to assume you're heterosexual. You say \"he's becoming homophobic\" and that you'd never really heard anything to indicate homophobia until your son was around. I doubt this is truly the case. I guarantee he got more noticeably homophobic as he had a son. Most cishet people care most about the gender roles and sexuality of their kids even when they claim to not be homophobic. But this kind of homophobia is unlikely to have spawned from nowhere. Especially considering his statement about having spent time with gay people\n\n3. An important thing to note is homosexuality in men is not inherently feminine in the slightest. You could remove your son from everything feminine and he still be gay. Because being gay is about being a man who sexually and or romantically enjoys men. Not about pink things and skirts. You could place your son in masculine only environments and it be nothing but a favour to his sexuality. \n\n4. So to continue from three, restricting femininity doesn't control his sexuality. He just feels judged. He learns two things. Firstly, that he is being watched and police to behave \"correctly\" and \"correctly\" means as a masculine straight man. And secondly, he learns that femininity, and by extension women themselves, are icky. Are less than. Is degrading to be. Is to be stomped down on. Your son is learning that when a man sees femininity the only adequate options are to control it or suffocate it. What kind of man do you think this produces? Do you think men who experience this upbringing might be more likely to hurt women? I certainly don't think it's a stretch\n\n5. This behaviour is controlling not just your son, but you. You are massively limited in your expression and even your ability to bond woth your son through this. Inevitably, your son will learn that femininity is bad and that what you like is bad, and will not like you. Will not trust you. \n\nHomophobia isn't just \"my husband hates gay people\".
