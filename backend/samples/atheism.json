Christians, Jewish people, lots of people are being protected by me that wouldn’t be protected by another type of president.”\n\nFFRF warns that such statements are not merely rhetorical excess but core features of Christian nationalism — the claim that the U.S. government exists to serve a particular religious identity. State violence becomes justified when its promulgators claim “God” is on their side.\n\nThat ideology permeates DHS itself. In July, the agency posted multiple promotional videos on its official social media accounts featuring bible verses, militarized imagery and artwork glorifying “Manifest Destiny.”\n\nOne July 7 video showed helicopters launching as a narrator quoted Isaiah 6:8 — “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? … Here am I. Send me.” Another video, posted on July 28, depicted Border Patrol agents in tactical gear as Proverbs 28:1 faded onscreen: “The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.” Other DHS materials celebrate “Manifest Destiny,” invoking the religious mythology used to justify westward colonization and the violent displacement and slaughter of Native Americans.\n\n“Quoting Christian texts to frame immigrants and asylum seekers as ‘wicked’ strips people of their humanity,” FFRF wrote in an August letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\n“What we are seeing is authoritarian Christian nationalism: state violence wrapped in scripture, enemies labeled as ‘wicked,’ and enforcement cast as righteous,” says FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor. “When the government starts to claim God’s endorsement, watch out.”\n\nIn Minneapolis and elsewhere, ICE operations have terrorized communities and their actions have led to deadly outcomes carried out by agents implicitly told they are soldiers in a moral crusade rather than public servants bound by our secular Constitution.\n\nAuthoritarianism relies on this dehumanization. It tells agents that cruelty is righteous and violence a virtue.\n\nThe cruelty was on full display as ICE officers surrounded, threw to the ground, beat, pepper-sprayed and then shot Pretti in about the space of one minute, simply for trying to aid a female protester being thrown to the ground by an ICE agent.\n\nAdds Gaylor, “Pretti was murdered, yet our vice president claimed the agents have ‘absolute immunity’ and Trump administration officials once again began defaming a good citizen as a ‘terrorist.’”\n\nNoem’s own record underscores the danger. She has repeatedly claimed to be divinely called to office and has openly stated that her biblical beliefs guide her governing decisions. On her first full day as governor of South Dakota, she sponsored an explicitly Christian worship service inside the state Capitol. She has promoted school prayer, endorsed Trump’s Muslim bans and dismissed the constitutional principle of state/church separation.\n\nWhat is unfolding now is a warning sign.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation calls on the public to recognize the Christian nationalist component of the rising authoritarianism for what it is: a threat to civil rights and the First Amendment, public safety, true religious freedom and democracy itself, and to demand a federal government that answers to the Constitution, not to claims of divine approval.", "author": "FreethoughtChris", "score": 1825, "num_comments": 12, "created_utc": 1769547014.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qoq5gs/minneapolis_violence_shows_deadly_reality_of/", "url": "https://ffrf.org/news/releases/ffrf-minneapolis-violence-shows-deadly-reality-of-religious-authoritarianism"}, {"id": "1r3u31j", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "California governor signs $90M 'emergency' funding bill for Planned Parenthood, abortion providers.

It was my small way of fighting back against Christian Nationalism. I'm not deluded, I know I won't be able to sway the person I'm debating. My target is always the much larger silent audience who has nothing invested. My questions are geared to get them to think. I've had 3 people come up and tell me months later that my questions formed the cracks in their belief and they're now deconstructing. Over thousands of exchanges? Not a significant number... but it's not zero either.\n\nIn any case, the method I'm using uses simple questions with zero assertions and I let them walk into the problem themselves. It's entertaining because they're used to just asserting or responding to people dunking...not used to people saying, \"I accept your framing...but lets walk that through to the logical conclusion.\"  Apologetics isn't built to handle questions.\n\n**Now here's where it gets interesting.  The ONE question I've asked that had the angriest responses was probably my simplest:**\n\n**\"What does the afterlife actually look like?\"**\n\nIn this debate group it's rare where I get outright anger... I was told \"you'll find out in hell\" or variations of that sentiment multiple times.\n\nTheir anger told me something... they've never given it any thought and were angry that I dared to ask the question. The ones that did try to answer ended up bringing more questions... that when interrogated, they usually ghosted. FYI, I consider that a win because it means they CAN'T answer the questions.\n\nBut one response was a gift I didn't anticipate:\n\nShe claimed the usual things about the afterlife... glorified bodies, reunion with loved ones, eternal bliss. Yadda, yadda. Then I asked about loved ones who didn't make it to heaven. She cited Isaiah 65:17 to explain that we won't remember them:\n\n>\"The former things shall not be remembered nor come to mind.\"\n\nShe thought this solved her problem. It actually destroys the entire promise.\n\nNow, some apologists try to limit this by pointing to Isaiah 65:16, the verse before, which mentions \"former troubles.\" They argue \"former things\" only means bad memories, not everything. But here's the problem:\n\n1. She didn't use that interpretation. She specifically said unsaved loved ones won't be remembered. That's MORE extreme than the standard apologetic, and she walked right into it.\n2. Even if we accept \"former troubles\" as the limit... your failures, your struggles, your growth through hardship... those are troubles. They're also what shaped you. Gone.\n3. If you DO remember loved ones who didn't make it, isn't that grief a \"trouble\"? They either erase the person from your memory or erase your grief about losing them forever. Either way, your mind is being edited.\n4. \"Former things\" in the text doesn't say \"former troubles.\" It says \"former things.\" The apologetic narrows the verse to make it palatable, but the plain reading is broader.\n\nIf the former things aren't remembered, there's no continuity of identity. The being in heaven isn't you. It's an empty vessel that doesn't know you ever existed.\n\nSo my follow up was: \"If you're not in heaven as you... if you have no memories of your earthly life... why would you want that? Who is the reward FOR?\"\n\nShe ghosted the thread. But she couldn't escape the ramifications.  Neither could the audience.  I have a ton of really good thought-provoking questions where I challenge them inside their frame.  But my simplest question was the one that a 10 year-old would ask has turned out to be one of my most effective.\n\nI learn something new every day... she handed me their own scripture and it nukes the only reason most of them believe.\n\nI thought I'd share here so those of you so inclined could have some fun with it.\n\nEDIT:  Since many requested, my method is laid out on my website here: https://www.rationality-project.org", "author": "slayer991", "score": 1514, "num_comments": 215, "created_utc": 1770162775.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qv8jzt/a_christian_just_handed_me_a_kill_shot_for_the/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1qv8jzt/a_christian_just_handed_me_a_kill_shot_for_the/"}, {"id": "1ql43im", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "Michigan Pastor Pleads No Contest To Child Sex Charges Just Months After Conviction Of Church's Youth Pastor, Faces Up To Life In Prison.", "selftext": "", "author": "Leeming", "score": 1478, "num_comments": 33, "created_utc": 1769204996.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1ql43im/michigan_pastor_pleads_no_contest_to_child_sex/", "url": "https://www.joemygod.com/2026/01/mi-pastor-pleads-no-contest-to-child-sex-charges-months-after-conviction-of-churchs-youth-pastor/"}, {"id": "1qlw01v", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "A pastor who rejects “established science” decided polio & measles vaccines should be optional.", "selftext": "", "author": "Leeming", "score": 1416, "num_comments": 86, "created_utc": 1769282181.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qlw01v/a_pastor_who_rejects_established_science_decided/", "url": "https://www.friendlyatheist.com/p/a-pastor-who-rejects-established"}, {"id": "1qksr4t", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "An Oklahoma lawmaker wants Creationism taught in science classes.

Attendance appeared to be mandatory. Project Pat was introduced by a person who asked students to identify themselves as Christian or Muslim and then led the audience in prayer. During his remarks, Project Pat quoted the bible, spoke about God and led students in prayer, expressing hope that they would accept Jesus as their savior. He concluded the assembly by distributing “The Tongue: A Creative Force” by Charlie Capps, an overtly proselytizing book.  \n  \nFFRF called out the district for the event, explaining that the assembly violated the First Amendment by subjecting students to school-sponsored religious exercise and coercive proselytization. “Students cannot simply leave the assembly without risking disciplinary action, nor is it reasonable to expect students to recognize their constitutional rights are being violated and dissent,” FFRF Patrick O’Reiley Legal Fellow [Charlotte R. Gude wrote to the superintendent](https://ffrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Haywood-County-Schools-TN-Religious-Assembly.pdf).  \n  \nThe school’s actions also marginalized students and staff who are nonreligious or adhere to minority faiths, FFRF pointed out. Allowing guest speakers, such as Project Pat, to proselytize during mandatory school events sends a clear message of exclusion to students who do not share those beliefs. Even if an opt-out had been offered, which does not appear to have been the case, voluntariness does not excuse a constitutional violation.

Mikie Sherrill as its “Secularist of the Week” for taking her oath of office on the Constitution rather than a religious text — thereby honoring the wall between her office and religion.   \n  \nSherrill, who was [endorsed by the FFRF Action Fund in the gubernatorial race](https://ffrfaction.org/ffrf-action-fund-endorses-mikie-sherrill-for-new-jersey-governor/), was [inaugurated as New Jersey’s 57th governor last week](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/democrat-mikie-sherrill-sworn-new-jersey-governor-defiant-tone-trump-rcna255101). Her utilization of the Constitution during her oath of office, rather than the often-used Christian bible, is a welcome break from the rampant Christian nationalism spreading under the Trump administration. Sherrill used during her inauguration ceremony a copy of the state Constitution owned by New Jersey’s first governor, the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.  \n  \nIn response to Sherrill’s exclusion of the bible, the Family Research Council, headed by notorious Christian nationalist Tony Perkins, swiftly took to its news and commentary outlet, The Washington Stand, to criticize her move. Joshua Arnold, a senior writer for the publication, [opined that the decision proves that “Sherrill plans to take God out of government.”](https://washingtonstand.com/article/so-help-me-law-nj-governor-sworn-in-on-the-constitution-not-the-bible) He [wrote that the move indicated](https://washingtonstand.com/article/so-help-me-law-nj-governor-sworn-in-on-the-constitution-not-the-bible) Sherrill “will be guided as governor not by what the Bible says, but by what the Constitution says.” Of course, this is how every governor in the United States should approach their office, honoring the foundational principle of separation of state and church.  \n  \nArnold depicts this as a negative thing, though, professing that the [Founding Fathers “drew many principles found in the Constitution from Scripture”](https://washingtonstand.com/article/so-help-me-law-nj-governor-sworn-in-on-the-constitution-not-the-bible) and that Sherrill’s inauguration ceremony was “calculated to deliberately sever the connection to Scripture.” Sherrill “does not need a biblical worldview because she already has another worldview — a postmodern, progressive one,” [Arnold remarked](https://washingtonstand.com/article/so-help-me-law-nj-governor-sworn-in-on-the-constitution-not-the-bible).   \n  \nArticle VI of the Constitution prohibits religious tests for all public offices, which [The Washington Stand acknowledged](https://washingtonstand.com/article/so-help-me-law-nj-governor-sworn-in-on-the-constitution-not-the-bible) while also contending that oath-taking ceremonies for elected officials must include an emphasis on matters of “conscience,” the metaphysical or the supernatural to be meaningful. Arnold argues that Sherrill’s decision to use the Constitution rather than a bible during her inauguration rendered the oath-taking ceremony “meaningless.”   \n  \nReligious texts are not required for oath-taking ceremonies at the federal or state level, though many officials choose to use a bible. That decision is left to the elected official. Notably, President John Quincy Adams took his [oath of office while using a volume of laws](https://guides.loc.gov/presidential-inaugurations/1789-1825#s-lg-box-wrapper-30915114).   \n  \nRegardless of whether a bible or a copy of the Constitution is used at an inauguration, all public officials in the United States should be “guided” by the Constitution rather than a religious text they personally ascribe to. Sherrill represents all New Jerseyans, many of whom do not follow Christianity or any other religion, and her decision shows that she takes that duty seriously and without imposing any personal religious beliefs on her constituents.   \n  \nFFRF Action Fund thanks Sherrill for the laudable decision and her commitment to our secular democracy.", "author": "FreethoughtChris", "score": 1251, "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": 1769809388.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qrj0qr/secularist_nj_gov_sworn_in_on_us_constitution/", "url": "https://ffrfaction.org/secularist-n-j-gov-sworn-in-on-u-s-constitution"}, {"id": "1qxkgu2", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "According to the Bible, MAGA Christians are going to hell", "selftext": "Christians today would tell you that simply believing in Jesus is enough to go to Heaven, but that contradicts the words of Jesus himself.  The gospels spell it out pretty clearly, and it directly contradicts the actions of MAGA.  Please note:  I do not personally believe in this, but Christians at least claim to believe it.\n\n>**Matthew 7: 21-23**\n\n>[**21**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-21.htm)Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven. [**22**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm)Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’\n\n>[**23**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-23.htm)Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’\n\n  \nStarting with this verse, we can see that just believing is not good enough.  There is a definitive will of the father that Christians are expected to do, otherwise they will be turned away.  What is the will of the father?  That is explained later in Matthew:\n\n>**Matthew 25:41-46**\n\n>[**41**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm)Then He will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [**42**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-42.htm)For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, [**43**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-43.htm)I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after Me.’\n\n>[**44**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-44.htm)And they too will reply, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’\n\n>[**45**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-45.htm)Then the King will answer, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.’\n\n>[**46**](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm)And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”\n\nThat spells it out pretty well, including the consequences.  There's nothing about hating gays, or stopping abortion, but plenty about actions that MAGA Christians reject.  The policies they support directly affect the poor in a negative way, and they do not care.  They see someone sick and hungry, and instead helping them, they worry how helping them would effect their taxes.\n\nIt's even more clearly detailed in Luke with the story of the rich man and Lazarus\n\n>**Luke 16:22-25**\n\n>^(22) “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. ^(23) In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. ^(24) So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’\n\n>^(25) “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. \n\nThe only reason given for the rich man going to hell was that he lived in luxury.  Is it any wonder why he was telling the rich young ruler to give away his money if he wanted to follow Jesus?\n\nThis is what I think of when I hear Trump and Republicans talk about hurting poor minorities.

And if you take time to study them, they will dispel all the anxieties stirred up by legislation and agitation like this. \n\nAnything legitimate that our colleagues want to say about preventing the imposition of Sharia law in America is already accomplished by the Establishment Clause. So everybody can rest easy with Thomas Jefferson’s Wall of Separation between church and state that he identified in his famous letter to the Danbury Baptists. \n\nLet’s say someone proposes that all public schools and government offices should post the core principles of Sharia law, which I don’t know what they are exactly, and I looked online and there were like 4 or 5 different versions. But let’s take one which said protecting religion, life, family, intellect, property and wealth. Another one said, protecting honesty, trustworthiness, mercy, humility, moderation and honoring promises. But whatever it is, if somebody said, we want to put Muslim Sharia law up in all the schools and all the government buildings, we would know very quickly how to deal with that because we’re not writing on a blank slate.\n\nIn fact, we’re in something of a furor over the laws compelling the posting of the Ten Commandments right now that were recently passed in Louisiana and Texas. But the Supreme Court already struck down such Ten Commandment laws in 1980, more than 45 years ago, in a case called *Stone v. Graham*, as a plain violation of the Establishment Clause, which forbids governmental endorsement of any religious text or any religious doctrine. We don’t even have one agreed upon version of the Ten Commandments. There’s a Catholic version, there’s a Lutheran version, there’s an Episcopalian version, many others you can find online. Which one would the government even endorse?\n\n**Well, we’ve got Members of this body who vehemently denounced Sharia law, but also agree with Louisiana and Texas that we should be posting the Ten Commandments of some particular sectarian variety up in the schools. When this came up last Congress, there were Members of the Oversight Committee who said we should not only be putting the Ten Commandments up in public schools, but in Congress in all public buildings. I told them the Ten Commandments have been doing fine for millennia without an endorsement by the Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives.** \n\nOne guy told me, well, you know, the Ten Commandments are the basis for the Bill of Rights. I was kind of confused because, you know, there are ten in each one. But I said, let’s test the proposition. The first commandment says, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” The First Amendment says, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” So I don’t think the First Commandment dictates the First Amendment. They wanted to go to the floor and have an up or down vote on the Ten Commandments. I said, if we’re going to vote on the Ten Commandments in 2025, we should vote on each commandment separately. And you shouldn’t be allowed to vote on any commandment you yourself have ever violated. That would make more sense.\n\n**In any event, this is** ***res judicata*****, it’s a closed case. The government cannot endorse Muslim law, Jewish law, Christian law, Methodist law, Baptist law, none of it. So we don’t need a special anti-Sharia law or a special anti-Sharia caucus. The First Amendment already takes care of it.** \n\n**Well, anything illegitimate or discriminatory that our colleagues would want to selectively impose on Muslims is, conversely, a violation of the Free Exercise Clause and also forbidden by the Constitution. Muslims afraid that Congress might actually impose one of these anti-Sharia bills—and of course, they’re just introduced for political purposes, I don’t think they have any delusions that they’re going to pass Congress—but if you were afraid of that, all you would have to do is read the case law to understand why that can’t be done.** \n\nCheck out, for example, a case with the wonderful name *Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah* in 1992, where the city of Hialeah in Florida selectively banned animal rituals and sacrifice by people practicing the Santeria religion. And the Supreme Court shrewdly said, look, if you want to have general laws that apply to every religion and to every citizen that bans certain kinds of animal slaughter as cruel or unusual or particularly harmful, then you can do it. But you can’t pass a law that targets a specific religion. Justice Kennedy called it “religious gerrymandering.”\n\nSo, I don’t know, Mr. Chairman, about the East Plano Islamic Center, which sounds like a compound with a mosque and some residential and some restaurants and so on. And of course, those kinds of religious compounds exist all across America, whether we’re talking about the Amish, the Mennonites, Catholics, Jews, you name it, lots of those exist. But, they do violate a separate principle if the government actually clothes them with secular power. So I would agree with you if they’re giving them the power to set up their own police force, their own school system, that would violate the Supreme Court’s decision in a case called *Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet.*\n\nThat was 1994, where New York created a separate public school district for members of the Satmar Hasidic Jewish religion in upstate New York. The Supreme Court said, no, you can’t endow a religious group with secular power. So if that’s going on there, then I’m with you. But if it’s not going on, then it’s just a compound. And if they own the property, it’s private property and they bought it. Why would we want to mess around with that? That sounds like you’re just vilifying and demonizing people because you don’t like their religion. And I know you wouldn’t do that.\n\nLet me just say, finally, to uniquely blockade members of a particular religion here, Islam, from participating in government or politics, the kind of thing you do hear from people calling for Ilhan Omar to be expelled from Congress or deported from the country, that plainly violates Article VI, Clause 3 of the Constitution, which says “no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.”\n\n**So let’s repose some of our faith and trust in the Founders of the Constitution, the Establishment Clause, the Free Exercise Clause, the ban on religious tests for public office. They’ve been working pretty well for America. I think they take care of every single thing that anybody’s talking about in this hearing, and I do think we’d be much better off getting back to the work of the country right now, trying to deal with the runaway problem of inflation, or to deal with the problem of the continuing Administration cover up of the Epstein files. Any of those, I think, would be a little more valuable. Although, I’ve got to say, as a washed-up professor of constitutional law, I do welcome the opportunity to remind people about the First Amendment.**\n\nI yield back to you, Chairman Roy.", "author": "FreethoughtChris", "score": 867, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": 1770917924.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1r2zw0u/jamie_raskin_just_schooled_congress_the/", "url": "https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ranking-member-raskin-s-opening-statement-at-subcommittee-hearing-on-republicans-unconstitutional-effort-to-restrict-religious-freedom"}, {"id": "1qk3r79", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "Christian nationalist pastor Joel Webbon says that he would discourage his daughter from marrying a moral, godly, upstanding Christian black man because \"I would prefer for my grandchildren to look like me.\"", "selftext": "", "author": "MrJasonMason", "score": 870, "num_comments": 138, "created_utc": 1769109247.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qk3r79/christian_nationalist_pastor_joel_webbon_says/", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe3llB4O3hw"}, {"id": "1qi5wi3", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "Freedom From Religion Foundation investigating claims of coerced religious conversion at Oklahoma jail.", "selftext": "", "author": "Leeming", "score": 857, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1768926867.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qi5wi3/freedom_from_religion_foundation_investigating/", "url": "https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2026/01/20/facebook-post-cleveland-county-jail-inmates-baptisms-religious-conversion-complaint/88179068007/"}, {"id": "1qnez0m", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "The story of Samson and Delilah is more ridiculous than I imagined.", "selftext": "I'd always heard about Delilah as a cunning woman who tricked Samson into believing he was in the hands of the Philistines.

Wade, Jesus-touting anti-abortion radicals held a rally in Washington, D.C., with President Trump and other GOP officials portraying the movement as a religious crusade. The pope sent his blessings, too.  \n  \nAlthough Trump did not appear in person, [he boasted via video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnAmC4KhMGw) about being the first president to actually attend the so-called “March for Life” six years ago.  \n  \nTrump reminded the march on Friday that his Supreme Court picks made the overturning of Roe possible. Underlining the religious nature of the anti-abortion crusade, he vowed: “That is why under the Trump administration, we’re strongly supporting religious liberty. We’re bringing back faith in America, we’re bringing back faith in God.” He concluded, “With your help and support we’ll continue to fight (for) the eternal truth that every child is a gift from God. Thank you and God bless America.”  \n  \n[Vice President JD Vance, who spoke in person](https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/jd-vance-speech-2026-march-for-life), told the extremists that “you have an ally in the White House.” He reminded them that at last year’s rally [he had exhorted](https://www.ncregister.com/news/jd-vance-addresses-the-march-for-life-2025-full-text), “I want more babies in the United States of America,” and then bragged, “You have a vice president who practices what he preaches,” alluding to his wife’s pregnancy.  \n  \nVance reviewed a long laundry list of the Trump administration’s anti-abortion “accomplishments”, saying, “We started by undoing the evils we saw under the previous administration; like, for example, throwing priests and grandmothers in prison for praying outside a clinic — that’s over. We stopped it.” He framed the fight against reproductive rights as being about “whether we will remain a civilization under God or whether we ultimately return to the paganism that dominated the past.”  \n  \nHe continued, “We know that family is not just the source of great joy, but it’s part of God’s design for men and women, a design that extends outward from the family to our neighborhoods, to our communities, and to the United States of America itself.” Vance described abortion as tantamount to infanticide, when in fact, access to birth control and abortion is what has largely ended that practice.  \n  \nA convert to Catholicism, Vance used the occasion to announce the expansion of the Mexico City Policy, known as the global gag rule, which bars recipients of U.S. foreign aid from promoting or even mentioning abortion. He elaborated, “We’re going to start blocking every international NGO that performs or promotes abortion abroad from receiving a dollar of U.S. money.” (The day after the march, [Vance further ](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/23/nx-s1-5683204/abortion-trump-mexico-city-policy)announced that the ban is being extended to silence any diversity, equity and inclusion policies or “radical gender ideologies.”)  \n  \n“All in all, we have expanded the Mexico City policy about three times as big as it was before, and we’re proud of it, because we believe in fighting for life,” said Vance. Tell that “concern for life” to the Africans at risk because of U.S. funding cuts [estimated to create as many as 2.8 million new orphans](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/hivaids/us-cuts-hiv-programs-sub-saharan-africa-pose-global-risk-experts-say) due to parents dying of treatable HIV/AIDS.  \n  \nTop GOP leadership at the anti-abortion rally also included House Speaker Mike Johnson, who touted actions to ban Planned Parenthood for receiving Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion-related health care, adding, “[Every single child deserves the opportunity to fulfill their God-given potential.](https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2026/01/23/vance-lawmakers-defend-trumps-abortion-policies-at-march-for-life/)”  \n  \n[The pope sent this message](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2026-01/pope-to-march-for-life-in-us-healthy-society-protects-human-life.html): “Pope Leo prayed that Jesus will accompany all those who peacefully march on behalf of the unborn. By advocating for them please know that you are fulfilling the Lord’s command to serve him in the least of our brothers and sisters.”  \n  \nNotes FFRF Action Fund President Annie Laurie Gaylor, “All in all, the annual anti-abortion march is proof positive that the fight to deny reproductive liberty in the United States is almost entirely fueled by religious faith and animus. In a secular society, the government — and in this case its male leaders — have no right to dictate their religious beliefs to the unwilling rest of us.”   \n  \nShe warned that Vance’s pro-natalist views go hand-in-hand with mandatory-motherhood policies common in many authoritarian countries.  \n  \nEarlier this month, [the Freedom From Religion Foundation condemned a Senate hearing](https://ffrf.org/news/releases/religious-ideology-drove-recent-senate-abortion-pill-hearing/) that served as a platform for anti-abortion lawmakers to spread misinformation about medication abortion, which accounts for a majority of abortions in the United States.  \n  \nFFRF Action Fund, the advocacy arm of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, will be helping to lead the fight against the revival of the antediluvian federal Comstock Act of 1873, the religiously motivated pet project of a 19th-century zealot, which bars the distribution of abortifacients or information about them through the mail.  \n", "author": "FreethoughtChris", "score": 613, "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1769453019.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qnotdn/trump_and_vance_describe_antiabortion_campaign_as/", "url": "https://ffrfaction.org/trump-and-vance-describe-anti-abortion-campaign-as-religious-crusade-during-dc-rally/?mc_cid=d7fdb22e8a&mc_eid=c2f5a74c82"}, {"id": "1r3yb89", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "After 30 years of debating objective morality with Christians, I finally realized I was missing the point.", "selftext": "In a Facebook Christian vs. Atheist debate group, another atheist asked a question. \"Is there anything god could do that would cross a moral line for you where you would say, \"okay that's just too much, there's no defending that as moral.\"? Or does god have absolute moral authority to do whatever he wants?\"\n\nAs atheists, we always point out the horrible things allowed in the Bible: slavery, genocide, incest, a virgin being forced to marry their rapist, etc.  But my questioning brought me around to God's commands, rather than his laws.  Specifically, 1 Samuel 15:3: \"Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.\"\n\nWhen I first asked this question in various groups, I asked it like this:  \"Was the command to kill women, children, and infants objectively moral because God issued it, or not objectively moral?\"\n\nWell, to my surprise, Christians overwhelmingly supported the murder of infants as moral.  But through my Socratic questioning and granting them the frame that God's command was moral and just, it led me to a better question:  why would God use human agents to commit infanticide when he had infinite other possibilities (including adoption).  \n\nThrough testing in multiple facebook groups I ended up expanding to 2 questions in relation to 1 Samuel 15:3. \n\n1.  What moral principle requires an all-loving God to outsource infanticide to his faithful people when he had painless alternatives?\n2.  As God is omniscient, he knew the long-term effects on the men who obeyed his command. Either they'd be tormented by slaughtering a helpless infant, or they'd be indifferent to it. How does a man being indifferent to killing an infant honor God? And how does tormenting the faithful with visions of slaughtered babies honor God?\n\nWell, through 4 facebook groups and 1 subreddit, not one person answered my question...but I had 2 theists admit it doesn't make sense.  Some of the answers were shocking.  One guy here basically stated \"the soldiers felt elation\" and \"bloodlust\" over killing infants.  Another one kept circling back to abortion (which had nothing to do with my position).  \n\nBut I also had the rare concessions:\n\"That is where my argument falls apart. I have no idea why it is worth it. I just have to assume it was worth it.\"\nand\n\"No, I don't like the idea of infants being murdered, and you're right, that would really mess with the Hebrew soldier's psyche. Imagine the guilt. Modern soldiers have guilt and violent war flashbacks and they don't even kill infants.\"\n \nUltimately, nobody wanted to talk about God's method of using human agents.  The common justifications were:\n\n1.  Divine Command Theory - God said so.  Doesn't answer the question\n2.  Hyperbole/metaphor - how?  Nobody says what it DOES mean.  They said it was just \"trash talk\" or \"hyperbole\"  How are we supposed to know when the text is real or hyperbole?  No answer.\n3.  Justice/Judgement - I already grant that frame, that still doesn't explain why human agents were required to fulfill his will and LIVE with it.\n4.  Test of loyalty or lesson to be learned - So infants were a prop to be executed?\n5.  Adoption wasn't possible/DNA/Nephlim - Showed how Rahab and Ruth were adopted so clearly that was an option. \n6.  We can't question god - In a debate group that's precisely the point.\n7.  Shifting to abortion - I'm not talking about babies being killed, I grant the frame that God can kill babies.  My question was about METHOD.  It's a dodge.\n8.  Soldiers were tougher - This is nonsense.  There's both Biblical and historical evidence showing that soldiers suffered PTSD before it was called that...going back to Assyrians, Greeks, and Roman warriors.  \n\nThanks to those that DMed me after my afterlife question about groups here I could question I posted it to 2 groups.  R/AskAChristian and r/debateachristian. The thread in r/debateachristian was pulled for asking a question as the premise.  So no Socratic questioning there. \n\nHere's the thread in r/AskAChristian with the full question:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskAChristian/comments/1r1ze2i/struggling_with_1_samuel_153_can_anyone_help_me/\n\nIf you want to see the full methodology behind this approach, I've documented it at https://rationality-project.org.

To do so Ceaușescu filed ‘Decree 770’ - The Decree banned abortions and contraceptives, implemented childless tax, put pregnant women on watch lists, had secret police monitor hospitals, and monthly mandatory gynecological exams - Education for girls in Romania was strictly reinforced to teach “The Glory of Motherhood”.  Children born during this time are known as ‘decrețel’ in Romania\n\nThe Decree did however allow exceptions for rape, incest, and health - as well as guaranteed paid Maternity leave. Women over 45 and women that had 4 kids were exempt from The Decree - even with those exceptions The Decree was still a major failure\n\nThe gynecologists would show up to workplaces unannounced - many gynecologists didn’t clean their tools (working with hundreds of women within little time) which lead to various vaginal infections and injuries\n\nThe birthrate surged, so did unwanted children, sex trafficking, and poverty.

He revealed that the “new” Capitol Hill event was run by the same insiders and veterans of the fellowship, preserving its power while attempting to regain legitimacy.  \n  \nNow, [as those two events appear to be recombining](https://jonathanlarsen.substack.com/p/national-prayer-breakfast-reuniting), Larsen has once again cut through the confusion.

At a time when theocratic movements are growing bolder and more entrenched, Jonathan Larsen’s reporting exemplifies what secular accountability journalism should look like: skeptical, deeply sourced, historically informed — and unafraid to name the real power structures at work.  \n  \nFor his sustained commitment to exposing the religious entanglements of government and for refusing to let secrecy and spin substitute for truth, FFRF Action Fund proudly recognizes Jonathan Larsen as Secularist of the Week.  \n", "author": "FreethoughtChris", "score": 492, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1769189806.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qkxazi/ffrf_action_fund_names_jonathan_larsen_secularist/", "url": "https://ffrfaction.org/secularist-journalist-has-laudably-investigated-the-national-prayer-breakfast/"}, {"id": "1qh5hk1", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "My mother just found out i’m an atheist", "selftext": "I FEEL FREEEE!!

Despite slick marketing and heavy political spending, these programs are neither about “choice” nor about improving education outcomes.\n\n“School vouchers are a massive transfer of public money to private religious institutions at the expense of our public schools,” says FFRF Co-President Dan Barker. “They weaken public schools, erode accountability and force most taxpayers to subsidize religious instruction in which they disbelieve.”\n\n**Public money, religious indoctrination**  \nThe majority of private schools participating in voucher programs are religious, [nearly 70 percent](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2021/2021061.pdf), and 76 percent of private-school students attend a religious school. In many voucher states, the numbers are even more lopsided. For instance, in Arizona [roughly 96 percent](https://azdor.gov/sites/default/files/document/REPORTS_CREDITS_2024_fy2023-private-school-tuition-org-credit-report.pdf) of voucher recipients attend religious schools.\n\nVoucher programs therefore function as a public subsidy for religious education, violating the fundamental constitutional principle that no taxpayer should not be compelled to support religion, especially someone else’s. While public schools welcome all students, religious and nonreligious alike, preserving a neutrality that serves all, religiously segregated schools typically require prayer, religious instruction and adherence to faith-based doctrine as a condition of enrollment.\n\n**No academic benefit, less oversight**  \nDespite decades of promises, [voucher programs have failed to deliver better academic outcomes](https://www.ncpecoalition.org/academic-achievement). Numerous [studies](https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/rsfjss/5/3/20.full.pdf) show voucher students performing no better, and often [worse](https://edex.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/publication/pdfs/FORDHAM%20Ed%20Choice%20Evaluation%20Report_online%20edition.pdf), than their public-school peers. Meanwhile, private schools receiving public funds are usually exempt from [basic transparency requirements, standardized testing, accreditation standards and public oversight](https://www.ncpecoalition.org/lackaccountability).\n\nFFRF’s maxim is: Where public money goes, public accountability must follow. When public money goes to private schools, the public loses the right to know how that money is being spent. That lack of accountability has led to documented fraud, school closures and students left stranded mid-year.\n\n**Discrimination and segregation**  \nVoucher-funded schools are allowed to [discriminate against students and staff based on religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability](https://www.ncpecoalition.org/lose-rights) — practices that would be illegal in public schools. These programs also exacerbate segregation, allowing schools to pick and choose students while draining resources from neighborhood public schools that must serve all children.\n\n**A coordinated political push**  \nThe recent expansion of voucher programs [has been driven by well-funded political groups and religious lobbying organizations](https://nepc.colorado.edu/blog/expansion-school), not by grassroots demand. Wealthy donors and national advocacy groups have poured millions into state legislatures to pressure lawmakers into dismantling public education systems under the misleading banner of “choice.”\n\n“Calling these programs ‘educational freedom’ or ‘school choice’ doesn’t change the reality,” notes Barker. “They are an ideological effort to privatize education and inject religion into taxpayer-funded schooling.”\n\n**FFRF urges lawmakers to invest in public schools**  \nFFRF calls on policymakers to reject voucher expansion and instead invest in strengthening our public schools — the bedrock of our democracy and which are open to all students, accountable to taxpayers and committed to educating, not indoctrinating.", "author": "FreethoughtChris", "score": 483, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1769725651.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qqn7kh/no_choice_about_it_vouchers_hurt_public_schools/", "url": "https://ffrf.org/news/releases/no-choice-about-it-vouchers-hurt-public-schools-and-fund-religion"}, {"id": "1r0j2yv", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "GOP Rep Thanks Jesus For Sending Trump To Save America From \"Blasphemy, Homosexuality, Perversion\" At Museum Of The Bible Prayer Meeting.", "selftext": "", "author": "Leeming", "score": 480, "num_comments": 101, "created_utc": 1770676789.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1r0j2yv/gop_rep_thanks_jesus_for_sending_trump_to_save/", "url": "https://www.joemygod.com/2026/02/gop-rep-thanks-jesus-for-sending-trump-to-save-america-from-blasphemy-homosexuality-perversion/"}, {"id": "1qest29", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "Maryland county council stops opening meetings with the Lord’s Prayer after residents and FFRF push back", "selftext": "The Wicomico County Council in Maryland has put a stop to divisive opening prayers after the [Freedom From Religion Foundation](https://ffrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wicomico-County-MD-County-Council-Prayers.pdf) and multiple residents in Salisbury, Md., complained.  \n  \nA concerned community member reported that Council President John T.

He concluded by saying, “I know that not everyone here is a Christian and that’s OK, I’ll pray for you. There’s only one way, there’s only one way, and that’s through Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior.”   \n  \nFFRF stepped up to remind the council members that their duty is to serve the town, not religion.  \n  \n“Observing a strict separation of church and state offends nobody, includes everybody, and honors the First Amendment,” FFRF Patrick O’Reiley Legal Fellow [Charlotte R. Gude wrote](https://ffrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wicomico-County-MD-County-Council-Prayers.pdf) to the council president.   \n  \nPrayer and proselytizing at government meetings are unnecessary, inappropriate and divisive. Council members are free to pray privately or to worship on their own time in their own way. They do not need to worship on taxpayers’ time. The council ought not to lend its power and prestige to religion by imposing prayer or personal beliefs on meeting attendees. Citizens, including Wicomico County’s nonreligious citizens, may be compelled to appear before the council on important civic matters and to participate in serious decisions affecting their livelihoods, property, children and quality of life. Additionally, the practice of prayer marginalizes the more than [30 percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/state/maryland/) of Maryland residents who are religiously unaffiliated.   \n  \nAfter receiving FFRF’s letter, the council changed its policy.  \n  \n“After consideration of the issues raised, the Wicomico County Council has determined that beginning in calendar year 2026, it will discontinue the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer as part of the council’s meeting agenda,” [Cannon wrote](https://ffrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wicomico-County-MD-County-Council-Prayers-RESPONSE-USPS.pdf) in a response to FFRF.  \n  \n“We’re very pleased the Wicomico County Council has started the new year by recognizing its responsibility to be welcoming, inclusive and secular,” says FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor.”", "author": "FreethoughtChris", "score": 453, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1768598961.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qest29/maryland_county_council_stops_opening_meetings/", "url": "https://ffrf.org/news/releases/ffrfs-work-finally-ends-maryland-county-council-meeting-prayers"}, {"id": "1r0dt6p", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "If God can exist without a creator, why can't the universe?", "selftext": "People often say that the universe couldn't have just happened  on its own, it needed a creator (God) to start it.

No one else noticed it/everyone smiled and cheered.

So instead of attending her mother's funeral, she went to a hotel room for sex instead. \n\nBy the time she finished her testimony, everyone took it seriously. They clapped for her, prayed with her, and some people were even teary eyed....\n\nNeedless to say my friend seemed to regret it more than I did, and apologized afterwards.

If you say Christianity is dangerous because… most of the time people agree. And they should.\n\nBut a post about Islam garners the ubiquitous “all religions are bad. All the books are just as bad as one another. Yada yada”.\n\nNo. All religions are bad for sure but some are more dangerous than others.\n\nJudaism has had a reform. If you go to Mei HaShaarim in Jerusalem you’ll find that it’s a horrifying blast from the past and that those people are living in a dangerous delusion… but \\*israel\\* is a secular country.\n\nIf you go to Nigeria, you’ll find people being killed for witchcraft and terrible stuff from the infancy of Christmas but Nigeria, for the most part, is a secular country.\n\nIf you go to Afghanistan… the law of the land is that it’s legal to stone you to death if you’re gay. It’s a \\*Muslim nation\\*.\n\nThats because Judaism and Christianity have had a reform. Their religious leaders have interpreted the backwardness of the ancient texts and made it fit into modern times… and while a ton of Christians would \\*like\\* everything to go back to the time where popes commanded armies, the most they can get is small (though not without horrible repercussions) victories. This is what we’re seeing in the US with abortion bans and the lack of trans rights. Yes… I’m not diminishing those things. I can’t stress this enough. ALL RELIGIONS ARE DANGEROUS.\n\nBut Islam has never had a reformation. The Islam of 2026 is the Islam of 700. A goat herder in Kabul picking up a Quran in 2026  is the same a goat herder in Kabul picking up a Quran in 726. It’s the same book, with the same rules. Muslim majority nations are theocracies, and while Christians try to make a theocracy in places, they get pushback… Israel has been pushing back the orthodox since the formation of the country. Islam gets no pushback… an average man in Qatar is content to wake up to the morning prayer, make sure his wife and daughter are covered head to toe, and go out to pray… and even if that’s bullshit, they don’t have a choice, because dissent gets to beheaded in those countries.\n\nIslam is \\*more dangerous\\*\n\nNot all ideas are created equal and not all ideas are as dangerous as the others.\n\nI just wanted to write this all out because I see it a lot and it’s been on my mind and you good folks have given me a platform to say it.\n\nEdit: you guys have made a lot of good comments and appreciate the discussion and have learned much.

I commented this too but felt it summarized my view perfectly so wanted to add it here:\n\nAll the religions are awful but prohibition never works… you just make a more powerful and more clever enemy\n\nThe only way to remove religion from the world is with education and reaching out and showing compassion, and most importantly showing that compassion can come from a place of secular humanism and doesn’t need a religion attached to it.\n\nReligion needs to be constantly mocked and criticized and people need to be made to understand that the mockery comes at the expense of the idea that they subscribe to… not directed at them\n\nWhich is why I think Islam needs to be mocked without comparison to other religions.

The groups also point to substantial deficiencies in required elements throughout the application.  \n  \n[The letter](https://ffrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-letter-to-SCSB-re-Ben-Gamla-application.pdf) is authored by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the American Civil Liberties Union, Education Law Center and Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. Most of these organizations represented Oklahoma public school advocates, parents, and faith leaders in a 2023 lawsuit to block Oklahoma from creating and funding St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, a proposed religious public charter school that was ruled unconstitutional by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 2024, a decision the U.S. Supreme Court let stand in 2025.  \n   \nIn today’s letter, the groups detail how Ben Gamla’s proposal would similarly violate the U.S. Constitution, the Oklahoma Constitution, the Oklahoma Charter Schools Act and the board’s own regulations, which make clear that charter schools are public schools that must be secular and open to all students and cannot use religion as a license to discriminate in admissions or employment.  \n  \n“Public charter schools are public schools, and public schools must be secular,” said **Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation**. “Allowing a religious charter school would open the door to government-funded religious indoctrination and discrimination, undermining the religious freedom of students, families and taxpayers alike. Oklahoma has already seen where this road leads, and there is no lawful basis to repeat that mistake.”    \n  \n“Establishing the nation’s first religious public school would be a dangerous sea change for American democracy,” said **Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United**. “We urge the board to protect public education and the religious freedom of Oklahoma taxpayers and students by rejecting Ben Gamla’s application. Public schools aren’t and should never be religious schools.”  \n  \n“The very idea of a religious public school is a constitutional oxymoron,” said **Daniel Mach, director of the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief**. “We hope the board rejects this application and safeguards the religious liberty of Oklahoma students, families and taxpayers.”  \n  \n“Although the Oklahoma Supreme Court has already made crystal clear that a religious charter school would violate the law, we are again faced with the need to oppose the establishment and public funding of such a school in the state,” said **Jessica Levin, litigation director at Education Law Center**. “We are proud to stand with a large and diverse group of people in Oklahoma and across the country who will fight to maintain a secular public education system that is open to all and rejects discrimination of any kind.”  \n  \n“Public dollars should strengthen public schools that welcome every child, not be diverted to religious institutions that exclude or indoctrinate,” said **Brent Rowland, interim executive director and legal director at Oklahoma Appleseed**. “The Constitution’s separation of church and state protects both religious freedom and public education. When the state funds a religious charter school, it violates that promise and drains scarce resources from the neighborhood public schools that most Oklahoma families rely on. At a moment when our communities are desperate for meaningful investment in public education, Oklahoma officials should reject this application and uphold the constitutional guardrails that serve all students.”  \n  \nAttorneys authoring the letter include Samuel T.

The arrest of Lemon, [after a federal magistrate judge had already rejected a criminal complaint](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/politics/don-lemon-justice-department-minnesota), raises grave First Amendment concerns. That the Department of Justice pursued him anyway, reportedly out of anger at the court’s decision, underscores the political nature of his arrest and its chilling effect on press freedom and the First Amendment.\n\n“The arrest of one of the nation’s most recognizable journalists, who was simply covering a protest, represents a dangerous escalation of government overreach. It’s an attack on the free press and a misuse of federal law,” say FFRF Co-Presidents Dan Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor. “It’s also an unconstitutional prioritization of certain pastors and religious institutions over the civil liberties of citizens.”\n\nRather than defending constitutional rights, Attorney General Pam Bondi took to social media last week to announce federal arrests and proclaim, [“WE WILL PROTECT OUR HOUSES OF WORSHIP”](https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2014349963132543319) and [“WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP.”](https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2014344323706302566) These public declarations make clear that the administration is extending extraordinary protection to a religious institution while ignoring or actively enabling daily violations of citizens’ rights.\n\nGovernment resources are being marshaled to shield a church from protest, scrutiny and reporting, even as federal authorities have killed peaceful protesters, terrorized immigrant communities and eroded fundamental civil liberties with little accountability. While protecting houses of worship from violence or credible threats of violence is a legitimate government interest, the rush to invoke federal law to suppress protest and journalism is not. Laws meant to protect individuals are instead being repurposed to privilege powerful religious institutions.\n\n“This case is part of a broader pattern FFRF confronts every day: the government treating churches as uniquely deserving of special protection, deference and insulation from criticism,” adds FFRF Attorney Chris Line. “The First Amendment neither grants houses of worship immunity from protest nor does it permit the government to weaponize federal statutes to suppress speech because it occurs near or within a religious setting.”\n\nFFRF stands firmly for the First Amendment, including its guarantees for the separation of state and church, freedom of the press and the right of citizens to protest government action, including when that protest implicates religious institutions entangled with state power. Selective enforcement that elevates churches while punishing journalists and protesters undermines the Constitution and endangers democratic accountability.\n\nThe government’s job is to protect the Constitution — not to act as the enforcement arm of religious privilege at the expense of public accountability and fundamental rights.

It was accepted as a donation in April from the American History & Heritage Foundation, an organization founded by activist Jason Rapert, a former Arkansas state legislator who openly opposes the separation between state and church. FFRF has received numerous complaints about the display, including several from Tarrant County residents.\n\n“This monument has no legitimate secular purpose,” says FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor. “It is a plainly religious display that promotes a version favored by Protestant Christians, thereby excluding not only non-Christians but Catholics, which sends a message that only certain beliefs are welcome in Tarrant County.”\n\nFFRF notes that the unveiling ceremony featured an explicitly Christian prayer and speeches by extremist Christian nationalist groups, including First Liberty Institute and WallBuilders. During the ceremony, Texas state Rep. Nate Schatzline offered a sectarian invocation that declared: “We don’t just make room for you, God, we give you Tarrant County. … Tarrant County is the Lord’s.”\n\nCounty officials have reportedly attempted to justify the monument by claiming the Ten Commandments reflect the moral and legal foundations of American law. History and law disprove that assertion.\n\n“The United States was founded on secular legal principles derived primarily from English common law, Enlightenment philosophy and classical sources, not biblical mandates,” FFRF legal counsel Chris Line writes to the Tarrant County Commissioners Court. “Many of the commandments are purely religious directives, including prohibitions on worshiping other gods, making graven images, taking the Lord’s name in vain, and observing the Sabbath. These provisions have no analogue in American law and are constitutionally barred from enforcement.”\n\nFFRF’s letter explains that the Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down courthouse Ten Commandments displays that lack a genuine secular context. While Van Orden v. Perry narrowly upheld a Ten Commandments monument on the Texas Capitol grounds deeming the grounds tantamount to a museum, the court emphasized that a new, isolated display would be more likely to violate the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.\n\nFFRF emphasized that, as a matter of policy, the county should not be displaying the Ten Commandments at all. “The First Commandment alone makes clear why this religious code has no place on government property,” Line writes. “The government has no business telling residents which god they must have, how many gods they must have, or that they must have any god at all.”\n\nSuch displays, FFRF notes, needlessly exclude and marginalize the 26 percent of Texans who are atheists, agnostics or “nothing in particular” and the additional 6 percent who subscribe to non-Christian faiths. In fact, the “Nones,” as religiously unaffiliated Americans have been nicknamed, are neck and neck with the evangelical Protestants in Texas (comprising 27 percent) the monument is pandering to. At the national level, “Nones” are the largest sector by religious denomination at three-in-10 U.S. adults, outnumbering Roman Catholics, Christian evangelicals or any other single denomination.\n\nFFRF has asked Tarrant County to remove the monument immediately and to confirm what steps it will take to remedy the constitutional violation and uphold the rights of all county residents, regardless of religious belief or or nonbelief.", "author": "FreethoughtChris", "score": 350, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1768943191.0, "permalink": "/r/atheism/comments/1qidjd6/ffrf_denounces_new_texas_county_courthouse_10/", "url": "https://ffrf.org/news/releases/ffrf-denounces-new-texas-county-courthouse-10-commandments-display"}, {"id": "1qwl1g6", "subreddit": "atheism", "title": "The Catholic church should have been destroyed nearly 2 decades ago.", "selftext": "Let's be real here.

Speakers repeatedly characterized abortion rights, LGBTQ+ equality, environmental protections and secular governance as “sins” and [“demonic attacks”](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/mike-johnson-prayer-repentance-demons-1234962043/) on the nation. The repentance urged by speakers focused less on personal morality than on the supposed failure of Christians to exert power over those who do not share their beliefs.\n\nAmong the featured speakers were leaders of the New Apostolic Reformation, a radical Christian nationalist movement teaching that believers have divine authority to “take dominion” over governments and institutions. Pastor Ché Ahn, who spoke at the “Stop the Steal” rally preceding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, lamented that Christians had failed to “occupy” positions of power. Other speakers preached that America is under siege by pagan gods and demonic entities that must be expelled from the halls of government.\n\nSeveral members of Congress directly embraced this rhetoric. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., prayed to “bind the demonic forces” seemingly possessing the United States of America. Rep. María Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., declared that “each person” in the country would serve and praise Jesus Christ, explicitly framing America as a Christian nation by divine design. Rep. Diana Harshbarger, R-Tenn., [explicitly asked God to cleanse the government of nonbelievers](https://www.friendlyatheist.com/p/gop-lawmaker-asks-god-to-cleanse): “And God, I pray that you would put godly people in places of authority and take those people out of those places that are not godly, Lord.”\n\nJohnson offered no criticism of these extremist statements. Instead, he praised the prayers of lawmakers as evidence that there is still “salt and light” in Washington and prayed for God to grant him wisdom to carry out divine will through legislation.\n\nFFRF has emphasized to Johnson in its letter that the United States was not founded on the bible, Christianity or religion in general. It was established on Enlightenment principles of individual liberty, popular sovereignty and a deliberate rejection of religious governance. The Constitution is a godless document by design. The First Amendment expressly forbids the government from endorsing, advancing or favoring religion precisely because the Founders understood the dangers of sectarian power fused with the state.\n\n“At a moment when Christian nationalism is increasingly used to justify discrimination and the erosion of civil rights, your words matter. They legitimize the false narrative that the government derives its authority from God rather than from the people, and that American law should serve religious ends rather than constitutional ones,” [Line writes](https://ffrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Speaker-of-the-House-Mike-Johnson-DC-National-Gathering-for-Prayer-and-Repentance.pdf). “The Constitution does not ask government officials to be faithful to God. It asks them to be faithful to the law.”\n\nFFRF is calling on Johnson to respect the constitutional limits of his office and to cease promoting sectarian ideology under the mantle of governmental authority.

Representative, I know you're a devout Christian, and so am I.\n\nThis bill, to me, is not only unconstitutional, it's not only un-American, I think it is also deeply un-Christian. And I say that because I believe this bill is idolatrous. I believe it is exclusionary. And I believe it is arrogant. And those three things, in my reading of the Gospel, are diametrically opposed to the teachings of Jesus.\n\nYou probably know Matthew 6:5 when Jesus says ‘Don't be like the Hypocrites, who love to pray publicly on street corners. When you pray, go into your room and shut the door, and pray to your father who is in secret.’\n\nA religion that has to force people to put up a poster to prove its legitimacy is a dead religion, and it's not one that I want to be a part of. It's not one that I think I am a part of. \n\nYou know that in Scripture it says ‘faith without works’ is what? Is ‘dead’. My concern is that instead of bringing a bill that will feed the hungry, clothe the naked, heal the sick, we're instead mandating that people put up a poster. \n\nAnd we both follow a teacher, a rabbi, who said don't let the law get in the way of loving your neighbor. Loving your neighbor is the most important law. It is the summation of all the law and all the prophets.\n\nI would submit to you that our neighbor also includes the Hindu student who sits in a classroom, the Buddhist student who sits in a classroom, and an atheist student who sits in a classroom. And my question to you is, does this bill truly love those students?’\n\nCandy Noble (R-Lucas)\n‘I’m going to go in a different direction than I think that you are trying to lead me.’”\n\nYouTube - [Texas Rep. James Talarico (D): ‘There is nothing Christian about Christian Nationalism.’](https://youtu.be/DlXOjqoylkk) (1:43)\n\n“Let me be very clear. There is nothing Christian about Christian nationalism.\n\nIt is the worship of power - political power, social power, economic power - in the name of Christ. And it is a betrayal of Jesus of Nazareth.”\n\n“Christian nationalists like to say that this is a Christian nation. Not only is that historically inaccurate. Not only is that theologically blasphemous, but it’s also just not true.\n\nLook around us. If this was truly a Christian nation, we would forgive student debt. If this was truly a Christian nation, we would guarantee health care to every single person. If this was truly a Christian nation, we would love all of our LGBTQ neighbors. If this was truly a Christian nation, we would make sure that every child in this state and in this country was housed, fed, clothed, educated, and insured. \n\nIf this was truly a Christian nation, we would never make it a Christian nation, because we know the table of fellowship is open to everybody. Including our Buddhist, our Hindu, our Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and atheist neighbors.\n\nJesus could have started a Christian theocracy. But love would never do that.\n\nThe closest thing we have to the kingdom of heaven is a multiracial, multicultural democracy where power is truly shared among all people. Something that is yet to exist in human history.”\n\nJames Talarico - [What would Jesus do if he visited the United States Senate?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/k3V-yjU5WEI) \n\n“What would Jesus do if he visited the United States Senate? \n\nI think he would say, ‘Depart from me.

I was a stranger and you deported me and my family.’\n\nAnd then I think he would flip over those fancy desks and demand that we take care of all our neighbors, especially the least of these. \n\nMatthew 25 [:31-46] tells us exactly how we will be judged and how we will be saved. By feeding the hungry, by healing the sick, by welcoming the stranger, by visiting the prisoner.\n\nNothing about going to church. Nothing about reading the Bible. Nothing about being a Christian. Just helping others. Just loving.”", "author": "Arrmadillo", "score": 38, "created_utc": 1770063147.0}, {"id": "o37u6s0", "post_id": "1qu3cuj", "subreddit": "atheism", "body": "He is for that, you clearly dont know much about him.", "author": "AndrathorLoL", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1770063430.0}, {"id": "o37hrv0", "post_id": "1qu3cuj", "subreddit": "atheism", "body": "My unpopular opinion is that atheists and progressives should reclaim the labels of “conservative” and “Christian” from the right wing in America because republicans are so far gone from anything related to conserving anything other than wealth for the ultra wealthy, which is borderline the most unchristianly thing you can do.", "author": "pringlepingel", "score": 29, "created_utc": 1770059929.0}, {"id": "o37ra8y", "post_id": "1qu3cuj", "subreddit": "atheism", "body": "You'd have to completely redefine conservatism to mean something else to sever it from its lust for authoritarianism.

In the case of Shurtleff v. Boston, the Court unanimously concluded that Boston violated the civil rights of a Christian group by rejecting its application to fly its flag on a City Hall flagpole. The Court determined that Boston’s longstanding practice of approving nearly all flag requests transformed the flagpole into a public forum, meaning religious views cannot be selectively excluded. This ruling applies universally, not just to Christian groups.\n\n\nThe Satanic Temple (TST) submitted a request to fly its flag in that same forum the day after the Supreme Court issued its ruling. However, Boston promptly denied the request, claiming that the flag program had already been suspended when TST submitted its application. The city then introduced new policies and reclassified the flagpole as a vehicle for government speech, which contradicts the Supreme Court’s decision. Under this new classification, city officials argue they can control which viewpoints are allowed to be displayed.\n\n\nShortly after announcing that all future flags would represent the city’s official speech, Boston raised a Christian flag. The city has not explained how this Christian flag meets the new criteria while simultaneously denying TST’s request. When TST filed a public records request to investigate the flagpole approval process, Boston claimed that no applications existed, including the one TST submitted through the city’s website. This denial is unlawful under Massachusetts law, which requires the disclosure of existing public records.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court clearly mandated that Boston end viewpoint discrimination in its flagpole program. However, the city disregarded this ruling and continued to exclude religious perspectives it disapproves of. The Satanic Temple’s lawsuit aims to remind Boston that compliance with constitutional law is not optional.\"\n\nCourt documents are linked in the update", "author": "Splycr", "score": 1157, "created_utc": 1770150364.0}, {"id": "o3epren", "post_id": "1qv35bh", "subreddit": "atheism", "body": "Fuckin' a Boston.

For many early Saints, plural marriage was one such commandment. It was a severe trial of faith for Joseph Smith, his wife Emma, and almost everyone who received it. To make it through this trial, they needed more than just favorable feelings about the restored gospel; they needed faith in God that went far deeper than that. The commandment no longer stands today, but the faithful example of people who lived it still does. And this example inspires us when we are asked to make our own “sacrifices in obedience” ([Doctrine and Covenants 132:50](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p50#p50)).\n\n[Come Follow Me Sunday School Manual 2022 Old Testament](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-sunday-school-old-testament-2022/25?lang=eng&id=p5#p5)\n\n>While we don’t know all the reasons Saul was commanded to kill all of the Amalekites and their animals, there are lessons to learn from his response to that commandment.

What are some good things we do in our lives that we sometimes choose instead of obeying God? Why is obedience to God better than those other good things?\n\n[Correlated Gospel Topics Essays of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng&id=p28#p28)\n\n>The revelation on marriage required that a wife give her consent before her husband could enter into plural marriage.[42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng#note42) Nevertheless, toward the end of the revelation, the Lord said that if the first wife “receive not this law”—the command to practice plural marriage—the husband would be “exempt from the law of Sarah,” presumably the requirement that the husband gain the consent of the first wife before marrying additional women.[43](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng#note43) After Emma opposed plural marriage, Joseph was placed in an agonizing dilemma, forced to choose between the will of God and the will of his beloved Emma. He may have thought Emma’s rejection of plural marriage exempted him from the law of Sarah. Her decision to “receive not this law” permitted him to marry additional wives without her consent. Because of Joseph’s early death and Emma’s decision to remain in Nauvoo and not discuss plural marriage after the Church moved west, many aspects of their story remain known only to the two of them.\n\n[Prophet Dale Renlund at the October 2022 General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/14renlund?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)\n\n>Some might point out that Nephi violated a commandment when he slew Laban. However, this exception does not negate the rule—the rule that personal revelation will be in harmony with God’s commandments. No simple explanation of this episode is completely satisfactory, but let me highlight some aspects. The episode did not begin with Nephi asking if he could slay Laban. It was not something he wanted to do. Killing Laban was not for Nephi’s personal benefit but to provide scriptures to a future nation and a covenant people. And Nephi was sure that it was revelation—in fact, in this case, it was a commandment from God.[23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/14renlund?lang=eng#note23)\n\n[Book of Mormon Seminary Teachers Manual - Introduction to the Book of Alma Lesson 79](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/book-of-mormon-seminary-teacher-manual-2017/introduction-to-the-book-of-alma/lesson-79-alma-14?lang=eng&id=p12#p12)\n\n>Invite a student to read [Alma 14:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) aloud, and ask the class to look for Alma’s response to Amulek’s request.
