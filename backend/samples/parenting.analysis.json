        "selftext": "I feel like borderline every parent I know (except maybe two generationally wealthy families) has to work. Dual-income households just to stay afloat. That’s not exactly breaking news. But what is insane is what that actually looks like day to day.\n\nWe work full-time jobs, which means waking up insanely early, rushing through one or two hours of morning chaos just to get everyone out the door, spending the entire day away from our families, then racing home to grab the kids, make dinner, and power through the nightly routine — cleanup, baths, bedtime, repeat. And somehow, in all of that, there’s basically zero time left for actual family connection.\n\nNever mind the people with hour-plus commutes each way (which used to be my life). Especially for full-time working moms — we barely see our kids during the week because someone has to make dinner and keep the house running. Yes, I know: meal prep. Blah blah. We do that too, and it still feels like we’re barely holding it together.\n\nWe live in these hyper-organized, tightly scheduled lives just to survive, and it’s exhausting. Daycare costs a fortune, it’s closed constantly, kids are always sick, and the stress is relentless. Some days I just want to… hang out with my damn kids.\n\nWho decided this was the model for the American family? Because I have some words for them. 🤬\n\nThis sucks.",

        "selftext": "Today of all days, my 15 year old is going to find out what failing looks like and it is destroying me on the inside.\n\nIt has been a struggle since the end of pre-school care (5th grade) to get my child up for the day and to the bus on time.  I would have thought it would get easier with age, but it has gotten harder.  I was taking him so school a couple of times per week when he missed the bus, but that made me late for work for the day.  I told him 2 weeks ago that I would no longer be providing ride if it was going to make me late for work.  It is his responsibility to get himself up and to the bus on time.  We have given him the tools, but he refuses to put them into action.  And he doesn't ask for rides, he demands them.  Since I told him that, my wife has given him a ride a couple of times and he has bummed a ride from a friend.\n\nToday he has a sporting event where he is supposed to be a big part of his team winning and they may not if he isn't involved.  His alarm goes off at 5am.  Mom pokes head in 45 min before bus.  Dad pokes head in 30 minutes before bus.  Son finally gets up at the time he is supposed to be at the bus and gets in the shower.  Comes downstairs 15 min before school is about to start and demands a ride.  \"Sorry bud, I told you 2 weeks ago that I will no longer be giving any rides if it makes me late for work, it is your responsibility to make the bus.\"  He talked to his mom next.  She is getting ready for work and can't drop everything to take him.  Offers a ride when she heads to work.  Not good enough!  He ends up walking (about 1.5mile, 1 as the crow flies) and it doesn't seem like he is moving too fast.  Gets to school late with an unknown absence.\n\nThis absence will likely make him ineligible to compete for his team tonight letting down his coach and teammates.  It will be a tough lesson for him and I hope he learns from it.  I am dying on the inside right now with my decision to stick to my guns and seeing him hurting.\n\n\n\nedit: pulled up my map and driving/sidwalk is actually 1.5mi. As the crow flies is just less than a mile.  Still a reasonable walk.",

        "selftext": "My 30 F and Husband 32 M tried conceiving for years. We finally were successful this last year and our beautiful little son was born in early December. Unfortunately for my little family my husband died 3 weeks later due to an unknown heart condition. It was sudden and unexpected but on top of the grief and missing my husband terribly I am now a single first time mom to a newborn baby. He’s now 6 weeks old and this has been the hardest 3 weeks of my life. My son is wonderful but I can’t figure out how single parents do this with no help. I haven’t slept more than 2-3 hours a night since my husband passed. My son won’t let me put him down without getting really upset so I hold him all day/night long until it gets to the point where it’s dangerous for him because I’m falling asleep involuntarily with him in my arms so I put him down in the bassinet and he cry’s himself to sleep and it breaks my heart. I can’t eat very well because cooking with him in my arms or in the sling scares me because I don’t want to risk him getting burned. I can’t shower because again he gets so upset when I leave him in the bassinet. Driving anywhere father than the corner is hard because I’m so sleep deprived. I’m just so overwhelmed. It makes me sad too because my husband is missing our sons first everything, my son is missing his dad and I’m trying so hard to enjoy and soak up how wonderful he really is but this I just so hard. I’m just so exhausted and devastated my family got torn apart like this. How do I get my baby to sleep in the bassinet? What do you single moms do for cooking and shower? Thankfully we had a good savings and my boss told me not to worry about taking time off and that Il be welcomed back whenever I’m ready even if that’s 6 months from now or longer. I just want to enjoy this time with my baby but everything is so hard. I miss my husband. I felt like when we were together I was doing a pretty good job. Now my son is down a parent and at that I’m in such survival mode that I’m sure I could be doing more. Iv been reading to him everyday and play him music regularly. We do tummy time 2x a day and he’s done good at all his appointments. I just know that whatever it is I’m able to do as his mom now I would have been doing better with my husband here. He made me a better mom. He took such good care of us both and was such an incredible dad. I had never seen him so happy or so proud. I just want to do good by him and be a good mom for my son. I just feel like I’m barely holding on.\n\nEdit: First of all, I wanna say thank you to all of the advice and people that have reached out and commented with ideas and input on how I can better my situation. I’ve read every single comment. The way cannot seem to find time to respond to everybody. I really appreciate everyone taking the time to comment with their help and advice.\n\nI took a few days to try and act on some of it before making an addition to this post. I have my husband‘s mother flying in tomorrow to help me for a few days. I do not want to fly with the baby yet as he does not have his shots, but I have a cousin who is going to help me in the meantime until I can figure out a long-term plan.\n\nI have done a lot of research on co sleeping and I found ways that I feel comfortable with it with me and baby on the floor. I also ordered myself a Cradle Wise bassinet, an Owlet  Dream sock, a Mama Roo baby swing, and a few different baby wearing devices to try to make my day easier. I was actually able to get more than three hours worth of sleep last night, I already feel a lot less frantic. I have somebody coming over to sit with the baby while I shower and meal prep a few things that I had delivered from the grocery today. Ultimately, I realize that this is going to be a hard time both physically and emotionally but that with help from the community, I’m going to get through it. I will have to learn to ask for help, probably a lot of it, which is not something I’m used to doing, but I will make it up to my friends and family when I can. I also joined a few of the local baby/mommy pages on Facebook in my area. So that once cold and flu season is over, I can start to make friends with other moms in my area.\n\nThank you all again for your condolences and advice. It was very helpful to read through everything and very kind words from everyone. It’s been a very difficult time but I’m determined to get through this and honor my husband by taking the best care of our baby and find a way through this and make him proud wherever he is.",

He’s a very charismatic, social kid and was talking about how he has 180 friends (not sure why that number lol) and asked me if I had 180 friends when I was his age. \n\nI said no, not really. That’s when he said, “yeah, probably because you’re not very pretty.” \n\nI didn’t really give a big reaction and told him that wasn’t a very nice thing to say, and he said, “what, it’s true. If you’re not pretty, people don’t like you as much” \n\nI didn’t know what else to say so I just wrapped up by saying, “it’s not kind to tell people their not pretty or to judge them by their looks” but omg. I didn’t know how to navigate that at all. \n\nDo I bring this convo up again or just leave it? I don’t want to get soooo in my feelings and make this a bigger issue than it is, maybe it was a kid being dumb — but also, I don’t want him saying these things to other people because it is hurtful.

        "selftext": "My five year old daughter got in the car after school this afternoon, and one of the first things she told me was that the teaching assistant in her class told her today that it was “time for her to retire her shirt”. As in, my daughter shouldn’t be wearing the shirt she was wearing today anymore. A long sleeved, pink shirt with a ballerina on it. \n\nI sat kind of dumbfounded for a second. My first thought was that she was commenting on the size of my daughter’s shirt, but it is brand new and fits her perfectly, with a little room to grow. If she raises her arms up in the air, her shirt rides up ever so slightly to show a sliver of her stomach, but like…c’mon. That’s a pretty universal problem. And she’s FIVE.  \n\nThen I was wondering if the assistant was making a comment on how often she wears it, but she’s only had it for a month and wears it once a week at most. \n\nI was thinking over it more tonight and now I’m really reading into it and getting all of those defensive, overprotective mom feelings. Like how society likes to police girls bodies, or how some kids can’t afford a lot of clothing and may have to wear the same shirt often. So now I’m just irritated and offended on behalf of my child and wondering if I should address it. \n\nBut this is also my first year as a mom of a school aged kid, so I’m really just a newbie in a whole new world that I don’t understand. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nWas this a weird thing to comment on, especially to a little kid? Or am I overthinking it?\n",

        "selftext": "On my second child. He's three weeks.... And honestly babies are just so awful if you don't get a good one. It's entirely random. None of the advice online to make them sleep works it's all red herrings. It's really down to the baby you get randomly assigned.\n\nMine right now won't nap properly during the day and I'm so over it. Nothing I try makes a difference. If anything it's just getting worse and he won't go into any kin d of deep sleep. I can't leave the crib side for more than five minutes so I'm literally locked in our bedroom. I don't get to spend anytime with our first born. In fact there are days where I basically don't see him and it breaks my heart.\n\nAnd all I can think is why would any one want to procreate when the first 5 months is just a marathon torture session for mums.\n\nYes what you get the other side is wonderful. I love my first born so much. But doing this a second time round I'm like there's no way in hell I could put myself through this again. No wonder people like us are giving up after one. I literally just have to quickly paint a couple pieces of wood on my son's new bed so I can assemble it\n\nFive days later and I literally haven't had the time. It's not even a big job to do. Probably 20 mins of my time. So he doesn't get his bed sorted and it's pissing me off. I won't even take me long to do.\n\nAnd all you get told is this is only a little while. Well 3 months when you're feeling every second of every day feels like a goddam year.\n\nMy friends are debating over a second one after a tricky first baby and I honestly think my advice would be don't bother unless you want to make yourself miserable for months on end.\n\n\\#defeatedmum\n\nUpdate: the midwife visited today and we discussed that he might actually have reflux which is why I'm struggling so much. so we are going to the doctors tomorrow I will update if that (omeprizole) makes a difference.\n\nUpdate 2: doctors were useless and won't prescribe anything because they think there will be not enough good coming out of omeprizole. I'm a bit disappointed they wouldn't even do a trial.\n\nOn the positive, my mum has finally come through and fronted up which has made managing quite a bit easier! Family really does make a difference. I have found going out and shopping very therapeutic and makes me feel so much more grounded and normal. Even with regular snack breaks for bubs and slow progress through the mall.\n\nUpdate 3. He's settled now during the day a lot more. I have yet to see how things go long term but I suspect he might have been over tired before so I'm trying to keep his wake window short . Co sleeping dangerous as it is, and special pillow set ups that break the 'rules' have been my saving grace. I now nap with him in my arms to catch up during the day. We still have 2 hours of screaming the house down at night but I know now he eventually tires himself out then does a good night sleep so I just lay there until he passes out from his anger fit. Makes me sad he's so sad but nothing stops the hollering so we just wait it out holding him.\n\nRe Dad, dad can't paint for shit so I won't let him lol and he spends his time working and toddler wrangling. While I do think those things are easier than baby I'm trying not to be too hard on him. I'm trying to let him get a full night sleep so we aren't both exhausted and not coping.",

We never did that action to either of them\n\nThen sometimes they just sit before each other and cat meows. If he wants to grab the cat - she taps him to stop and keeps meowing\n\nOtherwise son is doing great for a 2y old - trying to say simple things, understanding what we tell him, playing with toys and other children\n\nAs for the cat - she never had kittens and overall she is pretty normal, outside of being a bit \"non-violent\". She lets claws out only when threatened multiple times, when annoyed usually just pushes away with a paw or runs away. So we are pretty confident they wont hurt each other",

He was SO proud of everything and he dressed to the nines. The only person that came was his best friend. I watched him call and text everyone he invited, and they all told him they couldn't make it. My heart is so broken for him. I know there's nothing I can do. I want to be there for him, but I don't want him to think his mom is pitying him.\n\nEDIT: I think I posted on the wrong sub. My son is 17, he's not a little kid!",

        "selftext": "We are an immigrant family in the USA. Me and my husband didn’t go to school here, and the education system here feels very complex to me. Our child currently goes to an outdoor play school for preschool. He will stay there this year and for kindergarten too. We love the school and it’s absolutely amazing. But a lot of kids in his class will not stay next year because their parents want them to be in the same school from K through the end on elementary school. Also if I understood correctly it’s easier to get into the desired private schools in Kindergarten, than in any other grade.\n\nI went to visit a few public/ charter schools and I was so sad. I come from a country where government used to give money, grains, school uniforms, books, lunch so that folks send their kids to the schools (low literacy rate). But school used to be so fun. To us, school means large shade trees and grass covered play grounds. From grade 1-5 school was 8 30 to 1 pm, and a 40 mins recess. We had a very robust curriculum and our science and maths books were excellent. We have a very solid academic foundation.\n\nHere in USA even kindergarten classes are from 7 30 to 3 pm with 30 mins recess! Classes have screen times and devices. The school grounds are turf (and not real grass), kids have lunch inside the cafeteria (and never outside in the open air picnic style). Math and science is online from grade 3. Idk man, maybe things are different in other states/ private schools. But the public/ charter elementary schools felt very depressing to me. Also, is it a common thing in USA that classrooms have such little natural lights? What was the logic behind this kind of architecture? As an outsider I felt incredibly overwhelmed after the visits and need time to recover.\n\nI’ll look into it again in the fall. Right now my kid can eat leaves and smash acorns in his forest school.",

She is very outwardly religious. She finds opportunities to talk about Jesus and the Bible in class. Students have started writing Bible verses on the wall. My daughter (non christian) felt a little uncomfortable  but she still likes the teacher.\n\nThe long term sub kept having her end date extended so I decided to reach out to the principal. Here is my email:\n\n\"Hello Mr. \\[redacted\\]\n\nMy name is \\[redacted\\]  and I am \\[redacted\\]'s Mother. \\[redacted\\] has mentioned a number of occurrences in her ELA class where the long term sub, \\[redacted\\], speaks about or writes about her religious beliefs in the classroom. Specifically, there are Bible quotes written on the board and she speaks about her personal beliefs in the context of assignments or discussion. I don't think this is directly harmful, but I do feel that it is inappropriate. \n\nSeveral students have connected with her on this topic in the classroom space. Since there are students in the room that do not share the same faith, there is opportunity for students to feel and be excluded. I was hoping someone could look into this and determine if it is appropriate for the public school setting. \n\nThank you and I appreciate your attention to the matter. \"\n\nHe calls the next morning. It sounded like he was taking it serious and said he had talked to the teacher. I asked if he had mentioned our name and he admitted that he had said it was me. \n\nThe next day after getting the following updates... I sent this:\n\n\"Hello Mr. \\[redacted\\],\n\nI appreciate you following up to my initial email so promptly. I wanted to circle back after getting some updates from \\[redacted\\] tonight. \n\nYesterday, Mrs. \\[redacted\\] pulled \\[redacted\\] aside to apologize directly to her for the Bible quotes on the board. \\[redacted\\] has had a neutral response to the Bible quotes and the apology might have been out of place - I was the one that raised concerns. Today, Mrs. \\[redacted\\] asked \\[redacted\\]'s permission to use this situation as an example about censorship in Mrs 10th period class. The apology was well intended but using this as an example of censorship is concerning to say least. \n\n\\[redacted\\] is having mixed emotions about the situation, ranging from anger at Mom to concern that she played a part in \"censoring\" Mrs. \\[redacted\\]. \\[redacted\\] and I have talked a lot tonight and I think she's in an okay space for school tomorrow. \n\nI would prefer if Mrs \\[redacted\\] could avoid talking to \\[redacted\\] about concerns I've expressed. If you have to talk to \\[redacted\\] about this, please let me know so I can give her a heads up. Hopefully we can touch base tomorrow.\"\n\nHe calls first thing and agrees that it was inappropriate and says he will talk to her again. I'm not sure what resolve I want to come of this but I am GOBSMACKED that the teacher thought it was appropriate to tell my kid's peers in a lesson that a parent was censoring her and by extension them for not allowing biblical quotes in a public school setting. I'm mad that the principal felt the need to share which student's parent called. He could have easily given that feedback without singling out a student.\n\nAsking the student permission to share the story to another class is ridiculous, especially when the context was a discussion about censorship. My daughter felt like if she said \"no\" she would be further censoring her. \n\nI don't know how to unwind this. Kid is mad. Teacher is clueless about the separation of Church and State. ",

        "selftext": "Since turning five, my son has become absolutely intolerable. Everything is a battle or a meltdown. This morning it was because he couldn't have ice cream for breakfast (we don't even keep ice cream in the house). Yesterday it was because he didn't want to wear a jacket on the walk to school (we live in Canada - it's -25 celcius). He says hurtful things when he's upset - that he hates me, hates everyone, hates our house. He takes 45 minutes ro get dressed in the morning, and any time I pop into his room to give him a gentle nudge he yells at me. We try gentle parenting, we try discipline like taking away toys and play dates. Nothing seems to stick. I'm at my wits' end. I spent the whole past weekend crying in my room while my husband parented because I just don't have it in me. I love my kid, but lately I just don't \"like\" him - at all. He is rude and difficult, and he's slowly but surely chipping away at my mental health. Please tell me it gets better.\n\nETA: Wow, I'm feeling Reddit popular after all your responses. I can't reply to every one, but I'm reading them all and absorbing SO much insight. Thank you!",

        "selftext": "Honest question. My two are teens, so fortunately I’m on the downward slope of this, but it just seems to keep getting worse year after year. Perhaps it’s a middle class/upper middle thing, but I live in small town USA and still see it on a regular basis. My youngest has an organized weekend activity two times a month and here comes the sign-up list where you’re expected to supply a full meal for 40 teens once or twice during the year. Why can’t they just bring their own lunch/snacks? Or eat before or after?\n\nIt feels like this with *everything*. No more send-home Scholastic flyers where you just check a box and send in money. Now it’s a full-on book fair with increasingly pleading emails for volunteers to set up, tear down, work random times throughout the week, etc. No more sending a drink/snack with your kid for sports competitions; now it’s a whole “team snack box” thing with specific item requests and a whole complicated system organized through an app. No more student-designed sets for the theater production; now it’s a parent team taking this on and requiring multiple Saturdays and after-work hours to create professional-level sets.\n\nWhy? Why are we doing this to ourselves? I love my kids and am fully supportive of their activities but this level of hyper and granular parent involvement seems insane to me. Maybe just the Gen X in me? Anyone else relate?\n\n  \nEDIT: Based on replies, I’m thinking maybe some of this is generational. I had my kids late and am in my 50s. This level of parental involvement was absolutely not the norm for me growing up in the latchkey generation of the ‘80s (and I would never want to subject my own kids to that!) Maybe that’s why it feels so foreign to me. I just wonder if there is a happy medium somewhere in here. It’s interesting to hear everyone’s different experiences.",

I actively avoid any kind of news/politics around them.  They haven’t been seeing/hearing this stuff in the background, not in our house.

On one hand I’m disappointed in him *for not doing his assigned work.*\n\nOn the other hand I think it’s so stupid for a 6yo to have unsupervised iPad time in school EXACTLY BECAUSE OF THIS REASON. He does not have iPad time at home unless we are traveling and it’s not connected to the internet at any time. Open to any insight. I’m also pretty surprised that he knows how to spell poop because reading and spelling is a STRUGGLE here. For context he is 1st and teacher has been teaching this grade for 15 years.\n\nETA:\nHere’s the email:\n\n“Hello, I just wanted to let you know that we are working on ******. We were working on the portraits and I let the kids know that  if the needed to see an additional picture beyond the printed one that I gave them, they could use one of the kid friendly search engines that I provided links for to look them up. These search engines were ******. Unfortunatley kids were laughing at something inappropriate which led me to look search histories. He has (in the last two weeks) searched  pictures of poop and possibly other things, I havent done a complete search... We have discussed inappropriate behavior at school many times and have discussed using the iPads appropriately. I had to report it to our AP because it was on a school device, and she may reach out to you tomorrow. I am very disappointed in the entire situation.”",

        "selftext": "I love my son. He is the oldest of four. I have spent most of his life teaching him how to do basic household chores, he can cook, he's smart enough to look things up but he is also a slob, lazy, rude, and puts the least amount of effort into everything he does.\n\nHe turned 18 about 6 months ago. My husband (his dad) and I have both been pretty clear about our expectations for our kids once they turn 18.\nAs long as they were attending school or attempting to get employment, helping around the house, taking care of their hygiene and laundry,  and being respectful of our house, rules, and other family members they could stay at home as long as they wanted. They just needed to be on some path forward. \n\nWell my son hasn't been doing much of anything. He told us he wanted to move in with his girlfriend who lives about a block away. He wanted to move there a couple of months into the relationship, with multiple other roommates one of whom doesn't like my son and seems like he's jealous of his relationship with his girlfriend, he has no GED (he was kicked out of the GED program he was attending for not making any progress in months), and no job.\n\nMy husband and I told him it was probably not a great idea and shared our concerns but that it was his choice. He wasn't too happy we were honest. He has spent weeks saying he was getting his area ready and he would be moving soon. He was getting up early every morning and spending all day over there. He literally was coming home to poop and sleep. He rarely eats here because he's been cooking for his girlfriend. \n\nI had a surgery a little over a week ago and can't do any housework for 6 weeks. I told him that I would need help from him and his brothers. He said he would help. He was supposed to do dishes and they weren't getting done. We got into an argument 5 days after a major surgery because for the 5th day in a row the dishes weren't cleaned properly. This has been an ongoing issue for years of I'm being honest. I honestly don't get how he can't do it but his younger brothers, who have been taught the same way, can get the dishes clean and he can't. \n\nToday we had a family meeting. We talked to everyone about chores and then we sat down with my oldest to discuss what was happening with him moving. He instantly blew up. When my husband finally got mad, my son had the audacity to laugh, so we told him he needed to pack his things and leave. \n\nHe has been getting more and more disrespectful over the past several months because we would check in with him and see what his plans were; if he was actually moving, if he has looked into finishing his GED (he has one test) or been studying, if he's been applying for jobs, etc. \n\nSo he grabbed some of his belongings and went to his girlfriends. He came back later to get more of his stuff and apologize. My husband and I explained that we loved him, that it really sucked that it got to this point, that we would be here if he needed anything, that he was welcome here, but that we weren't going to keep taking crap when all we are trying to do is motivate him to do something productive and give our opinions. \n\nIf he needed to move back, he could, but he would need to show us that he can be at least a little more responsible, definitely more respectful, and more helpful. It hurts but I don't think we were wrong.\n\n",

        "selftext": "My 15 year old wants to attend a school wide walk out, and attend a protest. They’re reporting that half of their grade is intending on participating along with the juniors and seniors, they’ll be met by community members at a specific location to wave flags, hold signs XYZ. They won’t be near any ICE holding buildings or buildings that are conducting ICE business. My initial response was absolutely not. School is your priority and we’ve all seen footage of protests gone wrong however, I’ve always raised my kids to stand up for what they believe in, stand up for injustices, vote with your dollar, be uncomfortable doing the right thing and XYZ. Part of me wants to grant the permission to participate in the walk out / protest but fear is definitely holding me back. If this were a location that had LEO’s or ICE agents present, it would be an absolute no but because of this unique specific location, I feel more safe with the idea.\n\nWe also live in a pretty quiet small town but our kids high school wants to take a stand and get news attention that young kids/ youth are involved and it’s effecting all.\n\nHow are parents handling teens that want to protest?\n\n**Editing to add:** ***Admin is saying students will face consequences but yet faculty is hanging posters advertising the walk out. The coach even got involved at practice tonight and unfortunately the rhetoric was against participating, and went as far as saying “you guys are under 18 and don’t know the facts”.***\n\n***I’ve emailed the principal to first hand learn the policy and intended consequences.***",

This daycare has been around since the 60s and I’ve never heard of this happening. It’s in a family friendly area of the city, but few blocks down there’s been some crime, but it usually never extends beyond that area. My child’s been in this daycare for over a year and my older child was there for a few years as well. Maybe watch too much true crime but I am shaken. A child could’ve been hurt or taken. As a mother, my first instinct is to want to protect her and remove her from the Daycare. I know that problems exist no matter where you go, as do risks. I just need to get this out. What would you do? I intend to speak to the director on what their intentions are regarding security moving forward. Email below:\n\nGood afternoon,\n\nI just wanted to inform you all that an incident occurred at daycare this morning. A random man came into the centre initially enquiring about enrolling his children but he was not speaking coherently and became agitated during our discussion (I explained to him that we had no immediate openings). He started to become verbally abusive and acting aggressively. I asked him to leave the centre and when he did, he continued yelling at me while kicking our fence on the deck. Many of the children unfortunately witnessed this. While this was happening, we locked the doors and I immediately called the police. They arrived promptly and handled the situation.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask!\n\nETA: The building has no security - there’s 3 doors along the front of the daycare, each opening directly into a section of the daycare for different age groups. There’s no front desk, no second set of doors, etc. Anyone can walk right in. This guy walked right into the toddler section, and kids are directly on the other side of the door.",

I'm particularly fond of Charlie the Unicorn, The Narwhal Song, and Ferrets. I'm going to make a compilation and show him until he cringes out of existence.\n\n\n\nThanks!",

Then he looked down and saw my boy.\n\nHis eyes met mine again and something had shifted. They were suddenly alert, compassionate, full of understanding. Without a word, he put out his fist. My son walked up to the desk, and the man gave him a gentle fist bump. Then he did the same to me before going to sit down.\n\nIt was such a tiny interaction, but he saw and acknowledged so much in that moment. The fear, the bravery, the lack of choice, the heaviness of what we're going through. That a child should not have to know such things. It meant everything to me as a parent trying to keep it together for my kid.\n\nTo that stranger: thank you for your quiet compassion. It reminded me that kindness still shows up even in the hardest places. Some time has passed since that day, but I think of that interaction often and it gives me strength.\n\nAnyone else have a small moment like this that carried you through a rough day with your child?",

I wouldn’t mind posting a photo of the baby on Facebook (he is a little cutie) but don’t feel inclined to or passionate about it.\n\nThis is my mom’s first grandchild. She has asked me to post a photo of him on Facebook since I’ve had him because she wants her Facebook friends to know she is a grandmom now…. She will text me about it every other day and says things like “people will think there is something wrong with him” or that he is “ugly” if you don’t post.\n\nI’ve been getting pretty angry about it because I don’t understand the obsession with updating people online that you don’t talk to, see, keep up with regularly on a life change like becoming a grandmom. She gets defensive like I’m robbing her of something and my sister says she even feels bad because she can’t post. Am I wrong? She is still a grandmom even if she doesn’t post it on Facebook…. He still exists.\n\nETA: Thank you all so much for your input! I have no intentions of posting his photo but was feeling guilty I was “hurting her feelings”.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI wonder if anyone has been in a similar situation. I am 38 and my husband is 42. We have been together for 20 years and I have never become naturally pregnant, even though haven't used contraception in years. I have severe endometriosis and have had one ovary removed as part of a cyst operation years ago. I hardly have any eggs left actually (AMH lower than 0,5) and have been pre-menopausal since my early thirties. We have two gorgeous kids, almost 5 year old and a 18 -month old. Both kids are IVF babies that we somehow magically managed to have after years of fertility treatments that we spent all of our live savings on.\n\nThe past year has been the hardest of our lives. Our baby has sleep apnea and hasn't really slept for 18-months. My husband and I also both lost our fathers suddenly to cancer within four months apart from each other. My dad was my everything and his passing completely broke me, yet somehow I've had to keep going for the sake of my kids. He was also very present in our kids lives and helped us out a lot, so now we also find ourselves with no support network.\n\nThe reason why I'm writing, is that last month my husband and I had sex for the second time since our baby was born, which was quite surprising since our relationship has been really difficult with so many set backs this year. And from that ONE TIME it now looks like I'm pregnant. I thought I had already ovulated and anyway, I have never gotten pregnant from unprotected sex, ever.\n\nI just can't even understand this, this is the last thing that I would have expected to happen. I don't know what to do, part of me feels like this is meant to be and my kids are the best thing in my life and I would absolutely love to have a third. The other part of me knows that it's just too much. My husband doesn't want a third one, but the idea of abortion after everything that we have been through makes me feel sick to my stomach. I am afraid I will regret it forever, but worried if we keep the baby it will break us.\n\nAnyone else who has been in a similar situation? Please I would love all points of view.",

        "selftext": "I have a 10 month old and live about an hours flight away from my own parents. Both my parents are long retired and have no commitments.  They are also not short on money. \n\nThey have visited once since my baby was born and stayed for 2 days. On each of those two days they came over to see my baby for about an hour/two each time before heading back to their accommodation to nap etc.\n\nThey have no plans to visit again as far as im aware. They recently sold their house to downsize and I remember joking that they should move to the city I live in. My mum immediately hit me with the 'god no' and said she wanted to stay where she was because that's where her friends are. I absolutely do not in anyway expect her to move cities for me I just was a little bit hurt that the idea seemed so absurd to her.\n\nI have so many friends with babies that are the same age and a lot have grandparents that are moving closer to spend more time with them or at the very least visiting lots so I feel sad I don't have that relationship. \n\nI do not expect them to visit more or move to me, its their life, I guess im just a bit sad we dont have that kind of relationship where they want to be closer.\n\nAnyone have a similar situation? Am I overreacting?",

I have no idea where they get their information but I remember hearing jokes about OJ Simpson when I was their age.\n\nLast night, my kid (12, will be 13 in a few months) came to me and made an offhanded mention of the Epstein files; and I let the joke linger in silence long enough for her to realize something was amiss. She picked up the cue and asked me, \"what \\*are\\* the Epstein files, by the way?\" So I told her. She's always been fairly mature for her age and really well grounded so I answered her questions, and emphasized \\*how bad\\* those people are, and \\*how bad\\* people can be. I'm thankful that it seemed like she understood, at least the gravity of what I was saying. And then she asked me what \\*she\\* can do to help (she's been reading I Am Malala lately and has become pretty inspired). \n\nI told her that the best thing she can do is to know that jokes about the Epstein files (and Diddy for that matter) aren't funny, and I gave her some tips about how to handle those situations when her classmates make those kinds of jokes.\n\nI'm not sure what I hope to accomplish by posting this but I want to spread the word: Your kids are hearing about the Epstein files at school. It might be time to talk with them about it.",

I need to find some sort of “thing” or activity that he can get into and be good at. Poor guy just needs a win. Any team sport he plays he ends up on the bench. School is a challenge for him. He likes video games, but we don’t want him spending too much time on screens. I feel like this is starting to affect his confidence in himself as a person. He has tried pretty much any team sport as well as tennis and golf. We’ve tried chess, and piano lessons. He’s pretty good at skiing but we live in a warm area so it’s just when we go on a trip, so maybe every other year, sometimes every year. What else can we try? I don’t care about winning or anything like that I just want him to find something that he enjoys enough to stick with and see himself advance.",

My little boy got very upset and wanted to find me. He left the house to go after me. My partner didn't stop him. My 9 year old ended up going with him so he wouldn't be alone, and partner tried to call me (I had left phone in car) but didn't go after them. He said it was because he couldn't find the car keys. He is able bodied.\n\nWhen i got his message saying kids had gone, I tried to call back but he didn't answer. I drove straight home but couldn't see them, then drove a different way and found them. They were fine but had walked 1km to the supermarket (crossing two roads, including a main road) and halfway back when they couldn't find me (I had left shop to get petrol next).\n\nI was scared and now I'm livid. How could he?! And he doesn't see anything wrong with what he's done. I've told my little boy how dangerous that is and how it's not okay to ever leave the house without a grown up, and given him a consequence. But he doesn't seem to think it's a big deal, I'm sure because my partner doesn't think it is.\n\nIt makes me not trust him with the kids if that's his judgement. He downplayed it and refuses to discuss it unless I could be calm (I was angry but not being reactive or mean or nasty). I'm at a loss. What would you do?\n\nEdited to add: yes, he's the father of both children.",

        "selftext": "Our daughter is 3, going on 4.\n\nShe is what feels like a \"regular\" amount of picky for kids her age in our social circles.\n\nBut I see people recommend the \"Just serve her what you'd eat\" method all over the internet, and I'm wondering how effective that is. Who has tried it and succeeded? Tried it and failed? If your kid adjusted, how long did it take?\n\nI'm not entirely making my kid separate meals, but I almost always plan meals that can be deconstructed in a toddler friendly way. So that will normally be starches veggies and proteins cooked separately from sauce and seasonings, and then on her plate, I'll put the elements separately with a little bit of the combined dish. I'd love to be helping her widen her palate and not limit what we eat so much.\n\nI've had limited success with little games like telling her. \"Oh, I made a mistake, that's my food on that corner of your plate, please don't eat it all!\" and she will at least try and usually like the combined food, but at this point not without a game and a lot of attention.\n\nI don't think she has abnormally strong texture or flavor sensitivities for her age. Most things more than slightly seasoned she'll write off as \"spicy\" even if they have no heat. But she's generally into at least a couple veggies at any given moment. Green beans and edamame are easy wins right now.\n\nI have tried a few times presenting her with just the combined food we eat, and mostly she'll eat very little, needs to be coaxed, goes to bed hungry and wakes up in the night upset that she's hungry, which isn't great. I'm wondering if sticking with it longer has a good chance of pushing past the rough part. Also, would feeding her a safe food after she refuses dinner undo that? I've heard it recommend to use a \"boring\" food as backup. But I don't think she thinks of anything she likes as boring. It feels like feeding her any backup would teach her to just wait it out.",

I can see she wants the connection but is not able to make it happen. \n\nAt the beginning of the school year she would say “so and so is my best friend” and I’d see them together when I volunteered in the classroom. At this point she’s said almost every girl in her class has been her bf at some point. Its almost like kids like her at first then decide to not keep the friendship going.\n\nThose of you who had kids that were ”loners” did they eventually find their people?

        "selftext": "In Canada, mass shootings and school shooting are not common at all. We hear about some from the States and from other countries, but it isn't often a headline here. \n\nTwo days ago, someone killed 9 people and injured 27 others in a small town in BC. Most of those were at a school, and were around the age of my son, so it really hit hard as a parent.\n\nAt dinner last night, we asked him if his school mentioned anything about a tragic event that happened in BC. They did not mention anything, which feels wrong to me. I brought up what happened and he laughed about it, and said, \"that's it?\" When I mentioned how many people died. He shrugged it all off saying school shootings happen every day. He really believed that people shoot up schools in Canada every day. Even after explaining more and providing facts for him, he made a joking comment about \"bro's KD ratio\".\n\nI know teenagers tend to laugh at inappropriate things, but his complete lack of empathy, and jokes about what happened were unsettling to me. It felt like he really didn't care. I may misremember a lot of how I was 30ish years ago, but I don't remember finding Columbine funny when I heard the news. I especially can't imagine making jokes to both of my parents about topics like that. \n\nDoes his response seem too inappropriate, or am I just getting a reality check that this is normal for teenagers? \n\nEdit: A lot of comments seem to think we were pushing him for a certain response, but I'd like to clarify that neither of us told him he should feel a certain way about the situation, nor did we tell him his response was wrong. Our discussion was clearing up his belief school shootings are an every day occurrence, and brought up feeling safe in school.",

        "selftext": "I'm concerned about my son's recent change from being outgoing and personable to being a jerk.\n\nFor context, he's 14 and halfway through with his freshman year. Up until now, he's been a great kid and just a joy to be around. For his entire life, he's had what I think most people would consider to be a \"storybook\" upbringing (no problems at home, 2 parents, affluent family, no shortage of fun activities, friends, great relationship with me and his mom (my wife), and not a whole lot of pressure from us to excel in school or sports. And up until recently, it's shown: on top of being a solid student and super athlete (in two team sports), he's always been really social with tons of friends.\n\nHowever, things changed dramatically when he started high school in August. Now, he's just a jerk and quite frankly, very antisocial. He's rude to me and my wife and almost NEVER speaks. If we ask him a question or try to start a conversation, he mumbles back or worse, snaps at my wife. He's usual responses to everything are \"I don't know\" or \"I dont care.\" And if we ask him to do something (almost always for something that affects him - it's never to help us) he complains to no end.\n\nWe've taken a couple vacations in the past couple months, and it's just awkward and uncomfortable being with him. He will go for hours without speaking, and when he does, he's usually rude to us or his siblings. We went skiing last weekend and we'd ride long lifts up the mountain sitting next to each other without saying a word.\n\nIt's gotten to the point now that I can't stand being around him - and never want to talk to him.\n\nBut that's not the concerning part. He appears to not hang out with any friends (or at least very few) at school nor with his former friends and teammates too. He doesn't appear to communicate with them via his phone, and when we watch his games, he's started to sit by himself at the end of the bench. I also don't believe people are shunning him, and instead he's the one who's decided to remove himself from his former acquaintences/friends/teammates. As an example, when he played against another high school with a member of his club team, his friend came up to give a hug and my son \"cold shouldered\" him.\n\nThe only thing he seems interested in is his phone (in his defense, he has good grades and he still seems to want to play sports - he just doesn't talk to anyone). He seems to really only want to watch anime, and only some games (he used to play a lot of video games but rarely does that too, in favor of watching anime). In fact, we would be happy with video games since he plays the kind where people are talking to each other during the game.\n\nI've told him that he can't go through life in this manner. He's response is that he doesn't care and that he just \"doesn't want to talk to anyone.\"\n\nI understand that the teen years are extremely difficult; we went through another/different set of issues with his older sister last year, and as quickly as she spiraled out of control, she's recovered (in less than 1 year). I hope that he'll follow the same trajectory but i'm concerned that he wont.\n\nI'm at wits end and don't know what to do about this. Has anyone experience something similar? Please tell me this is just a phase and it will end shortly and everything will be fine again.",

This was a win because I had almost forgotten to (again), so I called it a night and went to bed. He’s 11, so he clearly knows that the fairy isn’t real, but he knows he gets cash if he doesn’t say anything. It’s a fun routine so, whatever. \n\nThis morning, I ran late and threw on the same pants from the night before. Hopped out to grab some gas after drop-off and found cash in my pocket and sleepily plopped it on the counter. \n\nMixed up in my cash, was my son’s teeth. Right there on the counter. I didn’t notice. After an incredibly long pause the gas station lady was like, “Erm.. do you want these teeth back?”. Took me a solid second to realize what she was talking about until it hit me that I had been walking around with human teeth in my pocket and I just dumped them onto a counter. \n\nSo anyways, I’m planning on not going back there for at least six months.

        "selftext": "I think I must be going crazy.\n\nMy friends and I are at the age where we are quickly approaching the college years with our kids. And of course the cost of college comes up.  \n\nNone of us will qualify for aid.  We all know that. And all of us have kids obsessed with the ivys and the brand name schools. \n\nI made the comment that we will need to back our daughter away from her ivy obsession for a couple of reasons.  1, she is very smart. But odds of an ivy are not in her favor (or anybodys favor, an ivy is a reach for everybody, IMO). She has a list, but we need some safeties and targets on there as well. 2, We know we cant afford it. There is no merit and the COA is just not reasonable. Even with the 529s and other support we know we will get. \n\nWe have done the math. We have our number we can reach that will get her an excellent education at plenty of places. Our state schools. Out of state publics. And colleges where merit is an option. But not any school that is high COA, no merit. \n\nAnd I dont want my kid applying to those schools where we already no our answer is \"no, we can not afford it.\" We can't sacrifice our retirement (no loan for retirement), it would be financially irresponsible for us to take a loan on to cover her tuition and even worse for our kid to take that level loan. Plus her desired career requires grad school. So taking on 100k+ before grad school plus there are younger siblings to consider as well. \n\nSo why does everybody act all aghast when I say this? I.e. \"you dont know that, everybody figures it out\" or \"They could give you aid​, you dont know\" (yes we do, net price calculators exist for a reason), \"you would say, sorry you cant go, if she got in????\" \"You have to let her apply and then you just figure it out as you go along\" or \"you never know\" etc. And even, \"well we don't know how we are going to do it, but she got in so we are just hoping we can make it work!\" (Said by a friend whose daughter is a Sr now) \n\nAm I being a total ogre/unfair parent? My goal is getting my kids through college debt free.  There are still fantastic options to achieve that for them. Why is everybody so horrified by the possibility of us refusing the financially out of reach option from the outset? Or do need -only schools come through in amazing ways that I'm not seeing or hearing about.\n\nI feel like people are acting like we are being so mean, our daughter will be so disappointed, how dare we...when we are trying to be realistic and responsible about what it costs to go to college these days?\n\nOne friend has a son going to a small top lac. They got 12k in merit a year. She said they have enough for 2 years saved but they don't know how they will finance the last two years but they will figure it out. Everybody is saying \"yup, thats what you do, just figure it out\" and all i think is \"how do you figure out 180k over 2 years?\". Again, I feel like I must be approaching this wrong. \n\nAm I nuts? Why do feel so bad that I cant pay 400k for college?\n\n",

I can see the sheer anger in his face when she starts screaming and flailing and clearly his frustration ends up making it worse. I was planning on having a second child but not if my husband can't deal with the pressure of it. He has never handled her aggressively at all and he will set her down when shes really upset and walk away but he can only stand like 10 minutes of it max before he just leaves her there at 2.5 months! I tell him her cortisol levels will go up if you just leave her there but he says nothing he does is working. After a bit of her crying, I always have to take her. I work from home, so I will come out and help as needed but its very distracting from work and I am only able to work part time right now because we don't want to put her in daycare yet. Yesterday, he said he doesnt like babies and I just started balling, most likely because of my hormones but it just hurt when he said that. I don't feel like I have much help in this and my baby is only getting more difficult with age (she was a very easy newborn). ",

        "selftext": "Hi fellow comrades in parenthood!\n\nWould love some advice on how you might approach this situation. I have a recently turned 5 year old girl. She's super smart, sensitive, kind, caring, hard-working - all the good things. But she is yet to have been awarded 'Star of the Week' by her teacher (it sounds trivial but it's seen as a big deal amongst the children and is given to the student who has been the best that week). Now, we're edging into February, and it looks like all the other kids in her class have had a chance to get this so coveted prize, except for my daughter.\n\nIn the end of term parent-teacher meeting held last month, I did briefly mention it to the teacher, asking if she was behaving, or if there is anything else we might not be aware of or that she needs to work on. We were told that she's such a great pupil, leagues above her peers in ability, settled far earlier than the other kids, and so they've been prioritising awarding the star of the week to those who are struggling the most in class...\n\nOkay I can sort of understand that. But in the mind of 4, just turned 5 year old, she's heartbroken every week when she isn't chosen. I know some students have received it twice so far this year...\n\nMy first instinct is to have another chat with the teacher and ask if anything is wrong, without being pushy?? Another part of me is just willing to carry on just remind my girl that she's doing nothing wrong, that she doesn't need a certificate to prove she's a star, and screw the system/down with formal education (of course kidding on that last part, but you know...). I'm not looking to take part in some corrupt scheme of pushing her to being star of the week by any means necessary, but it's just so heartbreaking every week when I see her little face at pick-up and she tells me, \"mama I'm not star of the week...\"\n\n\nOh the trials and tribulations of parenting school-aged children! Advice more than welcome!",

I’m trying to do the kind, calm, everything’s a learning curve thing but I also end up feeling lost that I haven’t enforced enough.\n\nI eventually said “oh no you broke Mummy’s watch, I can’t wear it now and I need it to know the time” he continued to laugh and I felt that small stir of anger inside me so I said “I think you can go play in your room for a little while” and guided him down to his room.  Reflecting now I think I need to raise it calmly this afternoon to Make the boundary clear to him.\n\nI find this parenting business so confusing and often feel so lost.  I definitely want to drop that reactive side of me but I have friends who calm parent and their lack of discipline seems to be a problem also.  (I do wonder whether they are doing it correctly)\n\nI would love to know how others would have handled this situation?\n\nEdit to add:\n\nThe scissors are stored out of reach. They had been washed and put in the dish rack, so it was a bit of an oversight in the chaos of the morning.  He doesn’t have free access to knives and sharp scissors but obviously I’ve learnt I need to dry and put away sharp things when they are washed.\n\nThe watch strap was a silicone Garmin strap.\n\nThanks so much to everyone who has responded with how they would handle this situation.  It has been so incredibly helpful to hear so many different perspectives and there is so much wisdom in here for me to take away.\n\nWe certainly do put boundaries and consequences in place etc but this situation just threw me and left me wondering what do others do - hence my question.\n\nWe’ve had a few chats about it today and he explained to me that mum got angry and made me go to my room - so I mustn’t of hidden it as well as I thought I did.\n\nThanks all",

Disappeared all day with neighborhood kids, built forts in the woods, hung out in basements playing video games, AIMed with friends after school, could get around independently on public bus, didn’t have a cell till high school…etc. \n\nMy kids are almost 3 and 5. They’ll never know life without AI. We live in the ‘burbs with nothing but schools in walking distance, in a a city with awful public transit. It’s just so different and I feel like they’re going to miss out on so much of what I remember making my childhood great. Trying my best to create the same vibes for them but it feels impossible.",

        "title": "Update to Teen Protest.",
        "selftext": "I posted recently about my teen wanting to participate in a walkout at school / attend a protest. This is just an update\n\nThe school was not organizing this walk out at all and has to remain neutral in politics per policy, this was 100% orchestrated by the student body to walk out and march together to a protest happening in our city. I just want to say how proud I am not only of my teen but all the teenagers there today. To stand up for what you believe in and even listening to some speak, they’re so educated and want to be a part of change.\n\nMy teen is also a varsity athlete who’s coach tried telling them that if they participated in this walk out that they would not be able to attend the championships- like not even ride with the team. The coach went on to tell them that because they aren’t 18 that they have no idea what’s happening, there’s a lot of gray areas and that kids need to just be kids. I felt this was inappropriate to share personal opinions as faculty and coaches must remain neutral. I contacted the Dean of students and learned that unexcused walk outs would result in a detention and unable to attend practice that same day. YES still able to travel with team and participate at the championships. \\*shocker\\*\n\nAt Championships the coach was very nit picky towards my teen and even tried to tell them they were late as they walked through the door at 9:25 when the sports app said “Athletes be there 9:30 SHARP”. My teen texted me about being late and I asked coach if I had the time wrong, coach went to my teen and asked to see “their messages to your mom because it’s about me” and my teen stood their ground that it’s their personal messages and they don’t feel comfortable with that. I did message the coach on the sports app saying to please not ask to see personal messages and that honestly this feels like retaliation for my teens interest in the walkout: protest.\n\nI did email up excuses my teen due to an appointment today to prevent them from facing disciplinary action, I joined them at the protest with my toddler on my hip and a sign in my hand.\n\nUnfortunately my teens in a long ish relationship and faced backlash from their boyfriend as they share different political views and he mostly just recites what his parents say. My teen responded back that their beliefs are important and to be respectful, I am SO PROUD that they still participated in this walkout / protest instead of trying to fit the BFs mold, despite intimidation tactics from coach and to see our community show up in such big numbers was truly inspiring.\n\nJust wanted to share this update.

        "selftext": "My 9 year old daughter “Sarah” has a best friend who lives two doors down. My daughter invited her best friend “Jane” to her birthday party two weeks ago and Jane attended. Sarah loved having her there. \n\nNow it’s time for Jane’s birthday party. When my daughter learned that it is being hosted at “SuperClimb”, a venue my daughter is tired of and feels she has outgrown, my daughter told me she did not want to go. She tried to make excuses to her friend. I told my daughter that there are plenty of times she can choose what she wants to do, and that she doesn’t have to keep her friend happy by making herself uncomfortable, but that in this situation, it would probably be a good idea to show up for her friend for the two hour birthday party because that is part of being a good friend. I told her that if she were being mistreated or frightened or if her friend never showed up for her, then it might be different. \n\nThere have definitely been times when one of my children has had a play date they didn’t want to go on, and I have listened them and either cancelled or rearranged. One time my 10 year old was too exhausted and emotional to see a friend the following day due to things that had happened and he told me it was all too much, so I asked to reschedule. Several times my 7 year old told me he didn’t like another child, so I cancelled play dates with that child and didn’t accept further play dates with him. But in this case, my daughter loves her friend, and simply doesn’t like the birthday venue bc she thinks it is boring. I would not make her attend an outing there for herself, but I see this as learning to be a good friend. \n\nJust wondering how others see it. Any other reflection on parenting through this? My daughter speaks her mind and seems connected to herself, and I love that about her. I grew up in a household that taught people pleasing and prioritising others above my own comfort. But in this case, I am thinking about how important give and take is in a friendship and trying to make sure I distinguish the line between that and people pleasing with my daughter. ",

The coach that was there said \"holy cow,  where did you come from?\". This year during live practice she had to wrestle this one boy. She pinned him within 20 seconds.  Her coaches jaw dropped. Yet he still pays no attention during matches. My daughter takes it personally,  started asking why the coaches don't bother coaching her? It's getting tiring. \n\nNow,  softball.  I signed her up for player pitch. She ended up going to coach pitch because they had one team and 17 kids on that team so I kept her back.  Her coaches and I got pretty close.  Her coach did tell me beforehand that my daughter was definitely ready to move up.  She asked to try catching and turns out she's a natural.  She was blocking,  diving,  etc. Her friend was also a catcher started before her.  But she asked her coach if she could try. She tried at the beginning of the tournament and ended up catching almost the whole tournament (my daughter)\n\nShe loves being catcher so much we bought her catchers gear,  foam blocks for our out building (38x48, so definitely room to pitch to her.). So she can practice blocking and diving without hurtinh herself or beating up her new gear. I've been working with her on it. I pitch tennis balls to her often.  The girl who catches her mom asked our coach if her daughter is ready to move up or just stay and play one more year at the level they were at.  Our coach told her, \"honestly,  she's not ready to move up. Hold her back one year\". She told us how she was signing up to be the head coach at the next level.  So she messaged us saying,  \"i don't want to lose you as a coach,  so i signed her up and i signed up to volunteer so she will be on the team\". \n\nI get a message today in a group message asking if anyone else got the message that try outs are this weekend. She sent the screen shot and it was from the little league program. It's to make sure they are safe to move up.  From the mom who volunteered to help.  I didn't get one. Her coach messaged back how there is one team,  12 girls and they have the list of girls they already chose the team before try outs but she has no access to the list. \n\nI swear I'm going to be livid if the girl who wasn't ready to move up as per coach statements moves up and my daughter who has been ready is stuck behind due to me not volunteering guaranting her spot on the team. I have a little one and i can't volunteer.  Her coach is going to ask the program  why i didn't receive a text. \n\nMy daughter will be absolutely devastated. Her soul would be crushed.  She's worked so hard to again be overlooked.  The level she was at didn't have catchers.  She will see her friend who was clearly not ready to level up,  level up and wonder why she wasn't\"good enough\" . I have a son I'm  tempted to convince him that sports is just politics.  Doesn't matter the talent you have. If you aren't donating tons of money or volunteering you just don't get a chance. \n\nI wish i never convinced her to play sports.  It's too hard watching her feel disappointed.  Its hard watching her fall apart.  I feel like I'm failing her because i don't have to option to coach or help. I'm scared to break the news of that is the news. Idk what I'm going to do. I cried on my way home silently because i thought about how hurt she will be if she didn't get invited to the try outs. ",

Any subtle discussions on if anyone is mean to him at school tell me he's got his buddies. But he doesn't get invited anywhere or for play dates, ever. Ive tried really hard to build relationships, I hosted a big barbecue with his friends, parents, and their siblings and everyone seemed to have a great time. Ive had good conversation with the other parents. The other parents are pleasant and happy to set up playdates, but don't  reciprocate. But he is still left out. \n\n\nWe went recently to a movie, his buddy saw him and they ran up to one another. His friend excitedly invited him to come sit with them. It was all his friends from school. I kind of brushed it off. Then we had one of his friends over, and his mom made a comment about how she would pick him up at a certain tome because they were going to the movies with that group (in front of my son, ouch.) \n\nI feel like it must be me or my husband at this point. It definitely hurts because I thought i wad doing a good job socializing and building those relationships, but obviously not. Is it normal? Nobody ever reaches out and Im starting to feel embarrassed being the one always initiating.",

        "selftext": "Do parents normally let their kids do these things or am I being too overprotective?\n\nSo my 15 y/o son gets annoyed and upset with me when I don't let him do certain things. He says things like \"You're so over protective and never let me do anything\", \"My friends' parents let them do it\".\nIn all honesty it both hurts and annoys me because I have gone above and beyond (even when I was not fully comfortable) to ensure he has some freedoms and consistent social interactions. This is because I was raised in a very strict household where my comings and goings were monitored and very limited and it caused me to rebel and do stupid stuff during my late teens early 20s. I would give anything to prevent my son from repeating the mistakes I have made and dealing with those consequences. So I allowed him to do things I would never have been allowed to do, even when they have made me weary. \n\nBasically I want to know if these are some things normal parents let their 15 y/o do and I'm the one that needs to be more flexible and lenient in these situations.\n\n1) Spend the night at his girlfriend's house because her mom will be there and he will be in a different room 😑 (there is no way Im crazy for saying no to this one right?)\n\n2) Randomly with no plans 10mins before school gets put ask to go to a friend's house after school (when I don't know the friend, parents, or location)\n\n3) Leave a restaurant with his friends and walk a mile to the local park for him and his friends to hang out when it's dark outside and the park is technically closed. (I allowed him to have dinner by himself with his friends at a restaurant and he sends a random text asking if they can leave and walk to the park to hang out).\n\n4) Drop him off in town and allow him to just walk around and hang out with a group of friends without any plan or destinationin mind. (I know this is probably craziest thing I've said no to, but it's difficult for me . I lost a close family member once from being hit by a car while crossing the street. My son also has difficulty paying attention to his surroundings, atleast from my perspective even if he does not agree with me on that. I know #4 is based more on my personal fears and experience so I'm trying to find a way to work on that)\n\nFrom my perspective I give him a large amount of space and freedom. So much so that I let him get on a plane and fly to a 3day school field trip to New York City (1000 + miles away). Even though I spent those 3 days with very little sleep, and anxiety levels through the roof all so he could experience something I NEVER would have been allowed to! \nIs it normal to let your teen do these things? I don't want to be \"over protective\" but I will definitely still protect my child, even if he doesn't like or agree with it. I just need some help seeing the clear line between the two. Any input or tips would be greatly appreciated ❤️ \n\nEdit: Okay I've noticed some stuff in the comments so let me give some context on my child specifically 🤣 I have let him do all those things except #1. \nThe one time I let him do #2 I asked him to text when he arrived and send the address, he did neither and when it was time for me to pick him up he didn't answer the phone because he was swimming so I had no clue where he was at or how to pick him up. \n\n#3 He has gotten a little better recently about \"communication\" so yes he did a very good job of telling me when he was wanting to switch locations and I complimented him on this but only AFTER  he got caught by his GFs mom skipping school and walking to her house. Even though he was allowed to go on dates or over too her house pretty much every weekend. I allow this because his GF recently had to switch to at home school due to her medical issues and they never got to see each other any more except on weekends. Better communication was the requirement to earn back trust and freedom.\n#4 Yea, I was pretty much already aware of this one being acceptable to every other parent. Like I said that one is something Im working on and I do allow him to do it sometimes, just not everytime he asks.\n\nWe don't have currently have phone tracking so I can't see his location, but that will most likely be something we will get soon.

        "selftext": "My almost 4yo wanted to sleep in bed with us. Barely ever happens so we agreed and started doing night routine. He got dressed in pajamas all by himself and was so proud. Even told us he didn’t want milk at bed time like a big boy. Brushed teeth and I told him we need to put his diaper (pull up) on and insisted no - even peed a second time in the toilet on his own to make sure it all got out. \n\nWe told him since it’s our bed, we want to make sure we keep it dry. A diaper is a must. He kept repeating “I’m not going to pee in your bed, guys!” He sounded so sweet and convincing I was almost tempted to let him try and we could place some towels under him just in case. \n\nMind you, not once has he woken up with a dry diaper. Sometimes he even leaks from it and I have to change his bedding first thing in the morning - even with peeing before bed. \n\nWe told him when he wakes up with a dry diaper for  three nights then we can try no diaper, but he wouldn’t budge on his stance. Eventually we told him thats the rule for our bed, or he could ho sleep in his own. I left to brush my teeth and could hear my husband negotiating with him still. when i came back, his pants were down as he laid on our bed face down crying. I think Dad did that and asked me to help put the diaper on. I did but by that point my son felt a little deflated. He asked for milk even though he said he wouldn’t, and it seemed like a regression in a short time. Like he’d wanted to be a big boy (put pjs on by himself, requested no diaper and no milk) and now we forced the diaper and now he wants milk. He said he wasn’t feeling “Hulky” anymore, I assume like the superhero and it broke my heart a little bit. \n\nI told him I believe in him. He can wake up dry and start working toward that. We all said good night.\n\nHow else could I have approached this? I don’t want the messaging for him to receive be “we say we believe in you but our actions won’t line up bc we will force you to do what is safest in the moment (in this case diaper bc of course won’t want a peed bed)”\n\nI know I’m overthinking one incident. This was probably the best move for tonight but I’m talking about larger messaging in the future ",

Anywho, I have these flashcards of first words I let my baby play with and we actually do the words, they’re like puzzles. \n\nI have the camera facing my baby as she’s bending up the card and my mom goes “No don’t do that, take it away from her.” I go, ”Nah she’s good, not that big of a deal.” My mom then proceeds to go “You need to teach her to treat her things right,” blah blah blah I’m like dude, she’s a baby, 1 year old at that, it’s not that serious, I don’t care about her ripping something up. My mom then proceeds to go “She’s going to be the boss of you .” I stopped and replied “Because I’m letting a baby be a baby? It’s a card, I don’t care”. She paused and followed up with “You know, it really hurts my feelings, I really don’t like when I give you advice and you just don’t listen to me.” I respond “I don’t know why, she just being a baby, she not going to be the boss of me because I let her fold up a cardboard card. She’s just being a baby.” Then she got quiet. \n\nIve already had plenty of conversations with my mom about the unsolicited advice and how she only hurting her own feelings because she’s giving advice I didn’t ask for. Theres some background as to why we don’t have the best relationship but I still allow her to be the grandma. Anywho, I’m not here to really ask for advice, more of just a rant. For context my mom is in her 60s so I don’t know if that’s boomer generation or whatever I don’t really keep up. but does anyone else’s parents act like this when it comes to the grandkids or am I tripping? like I’m letting a baby be a baby what do I do so wrong to offend? lol.

        "selftext": "I (45F) am really torn. My 16 year old daughter has a best friend (17M) who lives a little over an hour away. They do not get to hang out much because my daughter is too new to driving to make that drive and her friend is unwilling to get his license. His parents absolutely refuse to do any of the driving and say if they want to hang out together I need to do all the driving. They adore my daughter. They say their son is his happiest when they are together. But for whatever reason, they won't even drive one way. I work and average of 50 hours per week and have to be up by 4:00am everyday. His stepmom does not work at all, but does have 2 young children (3 and 6) I believe. I know it can suck driving with small children, but driving 1 way maybe once per month seems like it would be doable. He is usually with his bio-mom every weekend and she is a hot mess who should probably not ever be behind the wheel. I will keep doing the driving if it means they are able to keep the friendship going, but it is just really frustrating. Anyone have any advice?\n\nEDIT\\*\\*\\* A lot of people are suggesting the bus or public transportation. Neither are available in our area.\n\nEDIT\\*\\*\\* I just need to add a few things. This is my daughter's very best friend, not her boyfriend. They both have had very traumatic lives (I have posted about my daughter a lot in other posts if you are interested) and their friendship is a huge part of the reason they are still both alive. My daughter's friend has crippling anxiety and pretty poor mental health. He is afraid to drive. He is not in any form of therapy. I am not exactly sure why. I love this kid and will continue to drive if it is the only way they can remain friends. I just can't do it as often as I would like and wish his parents could help a little, but I get it. A lot of you have pointed out how difficult it would be to drive that much with two little ones in tow and after thinking about it, I understand. I will continue to practice highway/interstate driving with my daughter so she can make it there herself once the weather lets up a bit. We live in a very wintery area and there's a lot of snow and ice on the roads which complicates things a bit as well.\n\nI appreciate all the different perspectives and time you all have taken to respond ❤️",

We also don’t live close to our families so we don’t really have a tribe as such. He is 8 now  and the past two years I’ve been open to it but not sure if I will make the right choice. \n\nWondering if anyone can share their stories(with no judgment). Thank you! ",

I’m in the newborn trenches and, although I don’t think my baby is a hard baby, she does have acid reflux (just vomited on top of me) and colic so it’s really hard for her to sleep in her crib. The hardest part is the sleep deprivation (she only contact sleeps), the fussy episodes (poor thing doesn’t even cry that much so when she’s fussy I know she’s hurting from the reflux or colic), the isolation and the constant care.\n\nIs toddlerhood really harder than this? I mean I know they will demand much more active attention and involvement. But just the fact they’re more independent and you can actually sleep seems blissful!\n\nPlease let me know your experience with the newborn trenches vs infancy vs toddlerhood 🙏",

        "selftext": "My 19yo daughter is constantly making poor social choices.\n\nEx. Lying to bf, sharing bff secrets with others, creating false stories about her life to others, and other unnecessary nonstop drama.\n\nShe is constantly hurting herself and destroying her relationships. We’ve had to relocate her to another school twice already due to social drama. She has nuked every friendship she’s ever had.\n\nShe’s also hurt a lot of family relationships as well…\n\nIncluding me. She spread a horrible rumour about me for attention that destroyed my reputation in our small community. I am still facing backlash for this and struggling to forgive her.\n\nWhen this drama happens she gets depressed hates herself and has previously resorted to self harm/ED. Although this way of coping seems to be happening less thanks to therapy. But the drama is happening.\n\nDue to the fear of how she would handle the fallout I have admittedly gotten more involved in her social life in recent years than I should have as a way of keeping tabs on her and hopefully trying to prevent some of it.\n\nShe refuses to take advice when offered.\n\nInsists her way is best. Does the drama anyway and then regrets it and wishes she had listened. And will actually get mad at me for not forcing her to take my advice?\n\nThen repeats this cycle over and over.\n\nI’m so done and frustrated.\n\nShe refuses to learn or change in this regard.\n\nShe recently broke up with her last bf (on previous post) and immediately started talking to an ex of the only friend she has left in the world (the friend who has been supporting her through this breakup ffs).\n\nTo top that off she is lying to this guy about the same thing she lied to her ex about.\n\nSo obviously that’s going to go the same way…\n\nShe is good and responsible in other areas of her life. But socially she’s a nonstop trainwreck.\n\nMy younger daughter is the complete opposite. Ride or die friend and zero interest in drama. So I don’t know where I went wrong or how to fix it.\n\nShe is in therapy and has been for years. And it’s helped the way she handles things after they have blown up, but not stoping her from doing it in the first place.\n\nI love her but I need to walk away from being involved for her benefit as well as my own.\n\nI need to allow her to face the consequences but am struggling to do so. I want to swoop in and make everything good for her but I can’t.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nEDIT: Sorry to be clear I am looking for advice on how to let go of the fear that her actions will cause her harm.\n\nThank you!",

She decided to just skip her first period class entirely instead of a tardy.

I’m thinking “Hmm, pretty sure the school is not going to let that slide”\n\nI let her deal with the consequences. The fallout this morning was her teacher sent her to the office to get her absence sorted from the previous day. She called me. I’m working. I have calls to deal with and couldn’t talk to them right that moment. Unsure if she was even able to go back to class. Cant wait to hear about it at the end of the day today. \n\nBTW this girl gets good grades, but sometimes common sense escapes her. \n\nAnd I’m doing my best to let the natural consequences be her disciplinary result. Looks like I can sit back and watch to see what else might happen. Maybe I should have some popcorn ready for when she gets home. ",

        "selftext": "My mom (58F) thinks I (30+F) explain too many social things to my son (2M). She only sees us about once a month, and every time she comes to visit, we'll have an argument about her disagreeing with me \"spelling things out\" for him instead of letting him figure it out on his own. She thinks it'll let him develop better social skills and a stronger character if he is forced to navigate situations without \"excessive hand-holding\".\n\nContext:\n\n1. She didn't give a shit about my emotional and social development growing up because I was quiet, unproblematic, a \"smart kid\" and a \"good girl\". She was there to basically provide the life necessities; otherwise I was learning how to human on my own. Got into a lot of trouble because of it, which she has no idea about because I never shared. When I got into a big problem at 16 she did find out about, she told me in a disgusted tone: \"I thought you were smarter than this and didn't need us to explain these things to you\" - which, for whatever reason, is by far the most hurtful thing she's ever said to me to this day. And trust me, I've heard a lot of demeaning, hurtful things from her since I can remember.\n2. My goal in parenting is to raise a functioning adult, which includes independence in all facets of life, and my son has had alllll the freedom (age-appropriate, of course) to explore the world around him since he was born. We are NOT helicopter parents, and I do NOT insert comments about every little thing when he is safely minding his business and isn't looking at me for clarification or validation. As a result, he is truly very confident and independent for his age.\n\nNow, the situation that pissed me off today:\n\nShe's at out house, had a great time playing with my son. At some point, I was with them in the living room; he decided to take a break from playing, came to me and sat on my lap while I was sitting on the floor. Mom used this opportunity to check her phone and reply to messages. Everything's good, we're chilling. My son is holding his new toy and peacefully looking at it while I'm gently brushing his head. I say to him, \"Isn't that nice that grandma brought you a present? She was at the store, saw this toy, thought you would like it, and bought it for you. How great is that?\"\n\nMy mom, immediately: \"Was that really necessary? Did he need that explanation? Do you really think he doesn't understand that presents are nice?\"\n\n# GIRL SHUT THE FUCK UP\n\nedit: a missing paragraph + weird formatting. still can't fix it, sorry.\n\nedit25: i think i fixed it. edit37: if there are two bullet points for \"context\", it means i fixed it",

Watching and listening to 20 mins of my life from 6 years ago is such a trip. I miss my daughter dancing around and her little voice so much I started crying!! She is a teenager now and lots of sass. \n\nEven the videos from a couple years ago with my boys and their tiny toddler voices.. right to the heart! \n\nI try so hard to be in the moment and enjoy life but I’m so overwhelmed and drowning in responsibilities, it’s really hard. Then I look back on videos and pictures and feel like I missed it, missed enjoying it. \n\nOn these “slice of life” videos I’m sometimes short tempered with my kids and it breaks my heart. I found one of me scolding my daughter for not being buckled in the car. Did she need correction? Definitely. Was it probably the 8th million time I had told her and the end of a very long day on little-to-no sleep when her brothers were babies? Yes. In the moment I’m sure I felt justified but taken out of context it just hurts me to hear that sharp tongue towards my kids.\n\nUgh. I feel like being the mom my kids deserve is impossible. 😭😭",

This recent time we were invited to see The Wiz. Same deal. My son last minute asked if he could come. I quickly looked up tickets and bought two. The other dad invited another kid do it all worked. I sat with my son. The other dad watched the girls. \n\nMy son was tired (7:30pm show) but really excited. All throughout the show he was trying to get comfortable. He would take my arm and hold it against his chest. Wrap it around his body. Or hold it like a body pillow resting his head on it. I was half enjoying the show and half just sitting there enjoying his love of being there with me. The way he would turn to me and smile at every silly and funny part of the show. I enjoyed intermission when he held my hand as we walked to the bathroom. And the reality is I get to have many occasions like this with my son. I just really noticed it last night and I’m just trying to be in the moment and cherish it. \n\nI think it had a lot to do with turning my phone off during the show and I had no distractions while being with him.",

        "selftext": "Through the 14 years of my son’s life I’ve tried so hard to show I love him. I try to provide what he needs, take him to do things he might think are fun, and provide a stable place to live.\n\nIn the past I I’ve been careless and irresponsible. I wasn’t that good at keeping a job and I wasn’t a responsible mother in his younger years. I’m now in a full time job, I’m in school and I have my own place.\n\nEdit about the past…. When I say younger years I mean ages newborn to like 5. When I was younger, I was raised pretty much in state custody. I didn’t have much parental guidance because I was taken away from my family and whenever I got pregnant with my ex-husband, I was 20 and didn’t have a good blueprint on how parenting was supposed to go. When my son was four months old, I left my ex-husband because I walked in on him hitting him. I didn’t have a very good relationship with my mother and I was basically homeless with a baby. My mom often cared for him for weeks at a time because I was out doing my own thing and I wasn’t responsible as a mother at first. And I wound up getting with hurtful men who would either verbally or physically hurt me, and one of my ex-boyfriend‘s was very controlling and very verbally abusive towards both me and my son who was 4 at the time. It’s when I joined one of my churches that I found the support that I really needed to start holding down a regular job and being a better mother for my son.\n\nThat being said, we have had times where we have been close. We used to be able to talk about anything and everything. Things used to be easy for us to just discuss.\n\nOur interactions have been so tense. He seems to be so angry recently. He constantly back talks, gives sarcasm, and I’m just exhausted. I’m not sure how to navigate this. I don’t want to just leave it to fester. But I am at the end of myself. I scheduled counseling for both of us and I hope it can be a gateway to helping us reconnect as mother and son. I want to address some things before the situation becomes too tumultuous to discuss. Maybe he can shed some insight on what is going on in his head.\n\nThis has been something I’ve needed to do but I had hoped things would improve. They haven’t. Today is our first session… I hope it goes smoothly.",

I know I’m not supposed to compare, but I can’t help but notice how many extracurricular activities and just overall activities my kids’ friends do over the weekend and after school. I will admit that my husband and I are kind of homebodies, but we also just feel like we have to use so much of the weekend to catch up on shit that we can’t do over the week (e.g. food prep, laundry, cleaning the house, etc.). We try to do 1-2 things tops with our kids over the weekend. If the weather is nice we may go for a bike ride or to the park, but sometimes its literally just running errands. They get dropped off by the bus at 4:30 on weekdays so it’s also really hectic trying to figure out when extracurricular activities can be squeezed in with meals and such. I can’t help but feel really guilty that they spend a majority of the weekend and after school at home. And of course, when they are at home they will inevitably watch TV most of the time because we are getting stuff done around the house. I guess I’m just really struggling to understand how other parents are doing it.  Is there some magic secret that I’m not privy to? Let’s not also forget trying to do all this shit amidst the downfall of American democracy but I suppose that’s a whole different post. ",

Until 3m, a bad night looked like waking up 3 times. Our usual now is waking up 8 times. We started cosleeping 2 months ago as this is the only way I will NOT DIE.\n\nHis naps would be only 45min at a time, now 30min. If I stay with him in bed he might sleep longer, and before you tell me to nap with him, I TRY! But I am so anxious and exhausted that I lay there just praying he'll stay asleep, praying I'll fall asleep, but my brain knows he'll wake up soon so I CANNOT fall sleep at any time during the whole day, and sometimes during the night.\n\nI will not let him cry. Ever. I can't. My nervous system fires up and it doesn’t feel right for me.\n\nHe was still on 4 naps until 3 days ago, he seems to be stretching his wake window a bit longer so he started doing 3 naps, but nights are still horrendous. Waking up every hour most of the time and needing the boob. Not always to actually feed, mostly comfort. So boobless husband, who's absolutely great and willing to do anything, is kind of useless. This battle seems to be me and baby to solve.\n\nI tried later bedtime, earlier bedtime, bottle before bed, etc. Nothing changes.\n\nThe standards are low: I am dreaming of a night where he wakes up every 2h. I am feeling rage towards parents complaining of their babies waking up 2x a night.\n\nI live an ocean away from my family and best friends, so have no help. It's just me and my husband. I am so grateful we are able to choose to not leave him at daycare and I can stay home with him, and this adds another layer of guilt on top of all the other guilts. Like I have no right to complaint or to feel the way I'm feeling.\n\nAnd then we started solids about 1,5 months ago. Whoever said this was going to be fun: f\\*\\*k you. I put so much effort onto learning and preparing food, just so I get to spend another hour cleaning the enormous mess, and he doesn't actually eat anything at all. I KNOW! In the beginning, I don't have to worry about nutrition from food, and my expectations should be really low in relation to baby actually eating but I still keep offering to let him explore since that's the goal but WOW, the extra chaos this adds on me is so frustrating. And then I feel so guilty for feeling so frustrated.\n\nI am so angry, inpatient with my husband, I feel and unavoidable resentment towards him just for still owning his body, and not going through the changes and the exhaustion I am going through. I end up everyday apologising to him. He understands and can take it all but guess what? More guilt. I am an overstimulated, exhausted, angry person who's trying so hard to do things right and feel terrible about myself 100% of the time. I feel like I am a bad mother, a bad wife. My baby is perfect and healthy and I love him with my entire soul, and my husband is the best man in the world. I HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAINT! And yet, here I am.\n\nI am pouring from an empty cup. I get to do nothing for myself. My body doesn't belong to me anymore. I feel so over touched that I get angry when my husband hugs me in bed or puts his hand on my back trying to support me while I'm quietly crying in the dark putting baby back to sleep, already anxious about falling asleep myself quickly cause baby is gonna be up again soon.\n\nI don't know what I expect from this post. It's real fucking sad and I feel ashamed to be venting out to strangers on the internet.\n\nIf you read til here, thank you. ❤️",

She'll largely ignore my texts, but then suddenly get on the phone or Facetime and chat for an hour, so we didn't fight and have always had a great relationship.  \n\nAt first I kinda accepted it because she would be at school until 7-8 and I figured it made sense that she wouldn't want to drive here only to turn back around first thing.  But yesterday she was literally in my town at 8 p.m.  Hell, I bought a Switch 2 I was going to surprise her with and were going to play, but she didn't say anything and just drove back to her mom's house and didn't even respond to a text.\n\nI feel rejected and like a failure as a dad.  I've passed on a lot of personal and professional opportunities to ensure I didn't lose the last 2-3 years with her.  I can't ask her mom what's up because she'll just find a way to jab at me.  And telling a 17 year old to come home is only going to result in conflict.  \n\nIs there anything I can do?  Is there possibly something I've screwed up that I'm not seeing?\n\n",

What's okay, what's not okay, how to let your child have an appropriate relationship with screens and media. \n\nIf you have a chance to read it, its very interesting and gives suggestions for different ages and stages. \n\nThe major thing seems to be that caregiver involvement and oversight is critical to children's development with screen time and digital \"ecosystems.\" \n\nSome quick takeaways:\n\n* [S]tudies show consistent links between more time spent with digital media and less optimal child development, learning, social relationships, and emotion regulation.\n* Every child or teen develops their own unique relationships with media based on their temperament, strengths, and how platforms personalize content.\n* **Early Childhood (0–5 Years)** | High-quality educational content is associated with greater prosocial behaviors and language among preschoolers and kindergarteners. Certain educational apps *may* promote STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) and language learning. **Effects are strengthened by joint media engagement (eg, viewing together, teaching) with a caregiver.**\n* **School-Aged Children (6–12 Years)** | Excessive digital media use is associated with lower academic achievement, weaker attention control, and weaker cognition (fluid, crystallized intelligence, language). | Greater digital media use is associated with an increased risk of myopia progression, a more sedentary lifestyle, heightened exposure to calorie-dense foods, and elevated cardiometabolic risk for children and teens.\n* **Teenagers (13–18 Years)** | Optimal age of mobile device ownership is variable. Earlier age of device ownership for girls may be associated with worse behavioral adjustment. | Algorithmic amplification and social comparison can be associated with greater risk for those vulnerable to developing eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and self-harm behaviors.\n\n---\n\n# Caregivers\n> Caregivers share the relational environment to gatekeep, teach, and participate with children and teens around media. Digital media can act as a connector or disconnector in relationships. Connected relationships with trusted caregivers (relational health) promote healthy development in digital media contexts.93 Joint media engagement is associated with greater child and teen learning. Conversely, frequent digital media disruptions of caregiver-child interactions (eg, technoference) can be associated with child behavioral challenges.\n\n## Caregiver Stress\n> Nearly half of all caregivers report substantial stress in their lives, which is associated with greater caregiver mobile device use.\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n> Children and teens deserve to explore digital spaces filled with enrichment and community. Engagement-based designs are widespread but could be refocused toward children’s well-being. Child-centered designs are achievable, better for society, and can lead to digital products that promote children’s well-being.",

        "selftext": "My (27F) boyfriend (39M) and I moved in together about 5 months ago. He has two kids who live with us full time, 13F and 9M. And I have one 6M who lives with us 5 days of the week. His kids adore me and we have a great relationship. My son recently expressed that he does not like my boyfriend, to his father, not to me. Now I worry that it's about my boyfriend being strict. Here are some examples. The boys are not allowed to have drinks (other than water) until after they finish their food at dinner. They also have to eat everything on their plate. They also must ask for any snacks before they have them, and he restricts sugar intake. They have a bedtime routine on week days where they have to shower by 7/7:30 and be in bed by 8, but are allowed to stay up later on their iPads. He has taken my son's iPad away a few times in the last month when he does not behave at school. I'm unsure if these are the reasons that my son doesn't like my boyfriend, as he is allowed to do whatever he wants at his dad's house. My boyfriend does treat my son the same as his own children. The 13F we are less strict on because she is very responsible.",

His shift is 7-3 with a 1 hour commute.\n\nOur kids are 8 and 10. Our oldest is extremely capable and mature for her age, but has never been home alone before. My 10 year old has a cell phone since she walks to the bus by herself.\n\nAll together the kids would be home alone from about 6am-7:30am a couple days a week. I’d be home in time to take them to school, make breakfast, etc. and they generally wake up at 7 school days. We are trying to decide if this is okay or if we should find a sitter but that may be hard with the weird hours and such short time with the kids sleeping the bulk of the time anyways. Where I live there is no set legal age. Just looking for advice and opinions. We have a potential sitter lined up but she wants us to drop them off at her house and that would be 5:45am which is really gonna mess up their sleep schedules so we’d rather find someone who can come to us or just test the waters with the kids.\n\nTIA!",

And that she knows how to listen well and communicate her thoughts and feelings with her own words, is empathetic and helpful with other students and generally follows rules and gets along with everyone, knows how to handle conflict.\n\nI am so proud. I’m a single mom in my 20s and I have lost both my parents before I turned 25. I’ve been dealing with the grief and having to handle uni and finances and parenting all at once and was really scared it would negatively impact my daughter, especially since I ran into burn out last year and struggled to do a lot with her outside of basic needs. I tried to take as much time with her as possible when she was younger, consequently we didn’t have a lot of money so far. I felt guilty for so long but I think it’s paying off now.\n\nI don’t have anyone to share this with so I just wanted to leave it somewhere, also because it’s so easy to feel like a bad parent when you’re alone or are young so maybe this will also give someone a pat on the shoulder like it did with me 🥹 I’m so so proud of my girl. We can do a good job regardless of what our situation may look like to others! The best thing her teacher said is that she is joyful and a happy child.",

I tried taking her to some local gardens a few weeks ago for some fresh air, and she lasted maybe 2 hours. Wouldn't nap while I was walking around, and hated any spot I picked to nurse. I'm worried I may have started on the wrong foot keeping her home this long. I was so afraid of her getting sick.\n\nHow do you incorporate your LOs into everyday life outside of the home?\n\nEDIT: I want to start this off by saying thank you, all of you, so so much!

He's been bullied and struggles with some learning issues. As he's gotten older, I feel like he's struggled to find his place amongst school friends. He's not athletic despite all our efforts over the years to engage him in every sport possible. He's not interested in any clubs the school offers but he does participate in one after school activity related to his studies each week. He's on the golf team at school, he doesn't love golf but he's proud of himself for being on the team. He does not have interest in practice or getting better independently.\n\nOtherwise, he spends most of his free time in his room. He worked for two summers and saved up to buy a gaming computer. He's mostly into world building in Minecraft and he's found lots of others online to be social with. He has lots of fitness equipment in his room, he works out a lot and is very healthy physically. He's also into legos, so he spends time doing that as well. He's had a girlfriend or two, where he's made plans, spent time with her and friends and family; so he's not antisocial. I think he's just found a safe space where he's comfortable.\n\nMy husband and I fight regularly over my son's social life and interests. My husband is consumed by the fact my son is in his room all the time. He wants him to want to do other things. I feel like as parents, if we want him to do other things, we need to be the driver in that effort and we just aren't taking that initiative. We did for years when he was younger, but it's hard to make a 15 year old do something he's not interested in. I feel like when he's able to drive and work (they won't hire kids who don't drive around here), he will expand his social circle a bit and find himself doing more things outside of his room.\n\nI'm not thrilled my son spends time in his room, but he's a good kid, stays out of trouble, he's a great human being, he's able to talk to adults with respect and stand tall and proud, he's got a great work ethic, he's happy and healthy...I think being a kid just sucks for him, he doesn't fit in, hasn't found his place, and he's coping in a world that makes him happy for the time being.\n\nAm I way off base? Is my kid wasting his life?",

We both have kids around the same ages—her younger kids are 5 and 7 (she also has a 16-year-old), and mine are 5 and 6. She has her younger kids Monday through Thursday after school, while I have my kids every day plus the entire weekend.\n\nAt first, we had a “help each other with bus pickup” system, and then occasional playdates after school, which I thought was nice. But lately, it’s becoming too much. She’s late for the bus at least once a week (not because of work—she doesn’t have a job), and her kids ask my kids for playdates every day at the bus stop. Sometimes she even texts me asking me to FaceTime them if they’re upset. I’ve even had to get my child to say no on the bus so they don’t put me on the spot.\n\nWhen I do help, it often comes with expectations. Now, if I get her kids off the bus, they expect me to get them to our home and run in my home to have a playdate. I currently  can’t safely drive them because there’s no sidewalk from the bus stop due to snow, and my car only has three seats in the back—so I can’t safely fit four kids in. I also can’t walk because there is no sidewalks from the snow, and we live in a busy main road. I also know she doesn’t have booster seats in her car and her kids don’t sit in them, so that’s another safety concern I feel uncomfortable with all of these aspects\n\nI have watched her kids after school from 3–8:30 pm, sometimes more than once in a week. I will watch them that long and the next day after school they will be asking to come over again. It seems like most days the mom goes out, and the kids are either here with me, or being watched by the teenager... who usually has boyfriend over and smoking w33d. \n\nRecently, my son was sick, and I asned  her to watch my son for 3 hours while I went to class, I’m in college and I alrdy missed tons of class, and even though she’s never paid me, i offered to pay her. She said she couldn’t because she already had brunch plans, which is fine. But then she didn’t show up at the bus stop on time, so I ended up getting her kids off the bus. That made me feel upset  bc she couldn’t be there for me so I could go to school,  but the  I’m expected the same day to get her kids at the bus stop bc she was with friends. Normally we help each other out, but today I felt frustrated because it seems like she expects me to always be there for everything .i should also mention she asked me to get her kids off the bus a week or two ago for 3 days in a row, when my own kid didnt go to school because she was sick. So I went to the bus stop to get her kids when mine weren’t even getting off the bus (and keeping in mind she only has them 4 nights a week).\n\nOn top of that, her older child ( 7 YO) has hit my kids and done other concerning behaviors that I’ve had to spend months correcting. It makes me nervous letting them go upstairs unsupervised.\n\nI want to keep a small support system, but it’s feeling too one-sided. I’m a college student, my kids have been sick, I’ve missed school, and I’ve even lent her money when I had none. I’ve picked her kids off the bus when mine were sick and didn’t go to school, and she couldn’t wwtch my son for 3 hrs so I could go to class, but then she didn’t show up on time to pick her kids up off the bus.  I feel like she’s leaning on me way too much, and I’m exhausted trying to balance everything.\n\nI don’t want to completely cut off support, but I need boundaries. How do you politely set limits with a neighbor who keeps relying on you too much, while still keeping some support?\n\nI’ve lived here for almost 3 years so I am planning on moving, but it’s really not easy as a single parent who is in college with two kids and I’m trying my best to move this summer but it’s definitely gonna be a giant thing and I’m not sure if it’s possible but yeah\n\ni’m really glad I have   A little bit of support but at the same time I’m also drained and I feel like yes although we live in the same house we are two separate families and I don’t want to be like a default of like I don’t know. She said she texted me and she was like it’s like one big house and everybody’s welcome and like I don’t agree with that because I feel like we’re separate families and there should be more boundaries around that.. am I wrong ??",

        "selftext": "My daughter and I were having a discussion about pregnancy a couple years ago, when she was 13. The discussion was that  in reality, unplanned pregnancy happens, and every situation is unique. Even within the scope of entirely consensual sex, sometimes two people weren't anticipating having sex, but one thing leads to another, and they have sex. Sometimes birth control doesn't work. Sometimes couples that generally use birth control don't one instance. Sometimes people use less reliable methods of birth control. Sometimes because of age or medical conditions, people don't think they can become pregnant. Some couples aren't actively trying, but aren't actively not trying... etc.\n\nShe asked if my pregnancy with her was planned. Without going into specifics (because what kid wants to hear that?) I admitted that, no, I was not actively trying to get pregnant at the time, but was pleasantly surprised to find out I was. She wasn't bothered by this revelation at all (and jokes about it from time to time).\n\nShe was recently discussing this with her dad/my ex-husband. I guess he was a little annoyed that I revealed this.\n\nI guess in my family, it's just a pretty open topic? We don't really talk about our sex lives, but the timing of when kids were born and under what general circumstances is pretty well known. For instance, my sister had started dating an old friend after a bad breakup. She got pregnant, and they ultimately decided to get married and raise their son together. He's 19 now, he totally knows the story, and it's never been a big deal to him. A bit of a light cautionary tale of \"sex can lead to babies!\" but not a source of shame.\n\nWhat do you think? If a teen asks, would you share that info with them?",

My kid had nothing for his classmates to put his cards into, so I assume they just didn’t even notice. My kid didn’t realize it and when I brought his box, he stuffed a pile of stuff cards, candies) that was sitting in the ground. When we get home, he looks through the box, none of the cards were addressed to him and there were only few things anyways. Oh the devastation. So many tears. I felt so bad, took him to the store and got him his favorite candy but that hardly makes up for the missed messages he would have gotten from his school mates.

Wanna be a businessman, but now, not when he grows up.\nBut the idea of being an adult started to get outta hand.\nYesterday he cut his own hair, he found his dad’s beard trimmers and did attempt at shaving his sideburns. It looked awful. \nTook him to the barber today, said he wanted a buzzcut but I reminded him that he likes it long and he never shaved his head so he might not like it, he wanted to go into the barber alone (not his first time!) so I waited in the car while still watching him. He didn’t shave it and didn’t cut it really short kept it about the same length but half an inch shorter. He was fine with it, but once I started driving he said he wasn’t happy with the back of his head, said we can still go back and get it fixed he said no it doesn’t matter. Once we got home he said he doesn’t like it, wants to shave it all, I told him to go to sleep and we’d see tomorrow. \n\nThen he woke up at 2 am, saying he doesn’t like his hair and he won’t go to school like this, I said what do you want? Shave it all? He started crying heavily saying it’s now too short and he wanted to keep it long. And spent like a whole hour crying because he doesn’t like his hair. I comforted him, told him it will grow back in two weeks, suggested we use hair serums to make it grow faster. Nothing would stop the crying, he stopped and slept a while but then he was half asleep crying and whining, I prepared the nebuliser and inhalers thought he might get an asthma attack from all that crying and screaming! Last time he cried like that was when he was 2. \n\nThis is not the first time something similar to this happens, he thinks all businessmen have short hair, his father kept telling him that he doesn’t keep his hair short because he’s a man it’s because he’s bald! \nWhat should I do with this? Every couple of weeks it’s a new thing he’s obsessing about and then gets mad and upset and we wouldn’t know what to do. Last week it was about why we wouldn’t let him go out by himself. Before that he felt that he was finished with school and ready for a job, then asked the teacher to let him graduate. \nI’ve been told that it’s normal with tweens when I talked to friends and I should encourage him.

Sometimes when he coughs, it makes him vomit (I think it's because mucus gets stuck in his throat). This can also happen at night when he's asleep.\n\nWhen he goes into that phase, I often try to carry him to the toilet or sink so that he can throw up there. But my wife and her mom say that we should keep the child against our shoulder and rub his back to calm him and not rush to the toilet.. and basically let him throw up anywhere. Their logic is that the vomit can go into the lungs and choke him and we shouldn't care about things (like mattress, carpet, clothes) getting spoilt.\n\nI don't really know what to make of it, as it creates tension between us at times, because I was always taught to go to the toilet and also it can be a tough job cleaning stains/smell off the mattress and all.\n\n",

We’ve only done screen time on special occasions so she’s only ever seen 3 movies before, and all were very mild content wise. I remembered of course the scene where Littlefoot’s mother dies dramatically, and fast-forwarded through the whole T.Rex attack/mother dying part as I figured those would be too intense for her. I didn’t recall the rest of the movie being so emotionally charged and heavy however, and my sweet girl kept looking over at me for reassurance asking me things like “What happened? Where’d his mummy go? He can’t find his mummy?” When the movie ended she sat quietly and then crawled into my lap and started to cry- I felt awful and so guilty. I had intended to eventually show her lots of the 80s and 90s era movies from my childhood, but now I’m hard pressed to think of any that aren’t too dark or upsetting for someone so little. I hope I didn’t ruin dinosaurs for her:(",

I was going to shower and rinse off our infant in order to save time.  Toddler was going to have a bath with mommy.  Well up in the bathroom she decided she wanted shower with daddy instead - ok no problem - handed off infant to mom, toddler hops in shower.  I'm about to shampoo her hair when all of a sudden she EXPLODES that she wants to have bath with mommy.   Except at this point mom was already in tub, it was too much of a hassle to swap off again, and she had made her decision.  She screamed and screamed.  Basically ruined the rest of the evening from there.  \n\n  \nFor reference she's not quite 3 years old yet.  But seriously.  Every day is a fight.  It's wearing on me something fierce.   It's affecting my mood, my relationship with her, and I question EVERY THING I DO!  I feel like a terrible father and doubt my every damn decision at this point.  ",

It does feel like we are the only outsiders to the bunch as all of the other parents talk, hug, and catch up beautifully. \n\nI’m a naturally smiley, friendly person (especially when my kid is with me), so it feels extra weird to walk past other parents at pickup/drop-off mid-smile and get side-eyed or nothing at all. I’ve given it a full year to make sure I’m not imagining it, and it’s pretty consistent. I try to make small talk and get ignored. We also never get invited to playdates or anything outside of school. Its becoming frustrating as its super rude!! \n\nI started to wonder if they are for (whatever reason) are looking down on me? Im well put together and have a great career so not sure why that would be the case.  I havent had any historical issue with any of the families at all. \n\nI’m not sure if this is just normal parent-clique stuff, regional culture, or something I should approach differently — or if the answer is simply stop trying.

She's at school now but we will have to confront her with stealing and a lie (she denied it earlier). We've caught her in a few lies lately (denying that she ordered something on Amazon from her grandmother's account but did, denying that she edited her friend's story on her computer, but did). I feel like my once-beautiful and sweet daughter has turned into a sociopath and it feels out of control.\n\nWe will make her return it and apologize. But I am feeling she needs more of a consequence from this and need advice. She loves dance classes, should we pause those while she thinks about her behavior? Take her other beloved beauty products away? What would you do? I'm distraught.",

We realized from day one we weren't their first parents, but they're our only kids and I love our family and would do every hard day again for the life we have now.\n\nThat said, I still find myself anxious with every setback.  Whether it's from life struggles in general or from continued learning and disagreements with rules, it can get overwhelming.  Our one teen has anger issues and will yell, curse, or insult.  We've gotten to where the outbursts aren't as bad and don't last nearly as long, but it's still exhausting.  They can also come without warning either after a fun day ending or having to turn off the tv at bedtime, which we are trying to navigate.\n\nAs for our other teen, they withdraw a lot when they get overwhelmed and are the opposite.  The two are biological siblings, but both were different ages during their trauma and had different experiences with it.  So it also makes sense they handle challenges differently.\n\nI guess my biggest anxiety is either failing them completely or them getting to 18 and deciding they want nothing to do with us.  Is this normal whether your kids are adopted or biological?  Is it heightened because of the stress we've experienced through our unique journey?  My friends all have biological kids and said parenthood is always being anxious and feeling like a failure.\n\nSo maybe this is just how it's supposed to be?  It's so overwhelming.  We can have a few good days where I feel like everything is going to be perfect and our family is finally in a positive groove.  Only for a tantrum to happen with our one teen or our other to withdraw again and then I'm back to being convinced we'll never get this right and they will never view us as their family.\n\nI feel selfish.  My partner and I said in the beginning that even if they end up cutting us off when they're 18, we did this for them and we love them enough that giving them better chances is worth the risk of that pain.  The longer I'm a parent though and the more I face each new stage, the more scared I get of that possibility.",

        "selftext": "We have always had family rules with clear consequences in our family. \n\nOur 16 year old boy has NEVER had to have these consequences enacted in his teen years because a warning has always resulted in the behaviours calming. I am very grateful that he has been an ‘easy’ child to bring up.\n\nHowever, yesterday, he broke one of the rules we have set knowing full well what the consequences of this would be. I calmly explained that even though it is school break next week, the consequence of his actions would still be upheld and he would be essentially grounded for the first time. He did not take this well. \n\nHe is now acting out more than I’ve ever seen! Disrespectful language, slamming doors, one word answers to questions in a horrid tone etc. \n\nmy question is, is this a normal reaction? I don’t think he ever thought I would actually do it. it’s not like I’ve never followed through with consequences and punishments with his younger siblings so it’s not like I’ve just suddenly gone from laid back to authoritarian parenting! \n\nI understand it’s a shock because it’s the first time it’s happened but how to I deal with him at home for a whole week if these behaviours continue. I have explained that he is allowed to feel mad, but that doesn’t mean he can be disrespectful and mean. I have other children at home and I don’t want his attitude during next week to bring the whole household down. Any advice would be amazing! ",

If he’s bored, he’ll just sit next to me, begging for more screens or to text this or that friend’s parent to see if they can play (even if we’ve already confirmed that those friends are unavailable). If I offer suggestions of things to do on his own, he’ll flippantly reject all of them out of hand. If I tell him to go be bored away from me, he’ll return a couple minutes later to once again share how bored he is and beg for more screens.\n\nAnd to be clear, my son has plenty of entertainment available to him. He usually has friends to play with. I frequently do stuff with him or take him places. He has toys and access to creative activities. He has plenty of physical books and books on tape. He just refuses to take any initiative to entertain himself in the event that another human isn‘t available to him.\n\nDoes anyone have experience dealing with a kid like this? I guess I could start giving him chores when he claims boredom.",

I am now having major regret. \n\nWhen my son was around 18 months old, the TV started getting used more and more. I began working again, I have my own business which I operate from home (I am a cake decorator). I have no child care options and no family help, so my kids are always in my care. Never unsupervised, and always in the same space as me, however I started using the TV to provide some distraction while baking otherwise it was very challenging. I look back now and realise I was using the TV as a baby sitter. \n\nI really regret this. I have been in an impossible situation where I need to work financially but without child care I am at a loss with what to do. I have tried to set up activities and do things to keep him occupied for short periods but he is quite destructive and has a short attention span sometimes. I take regular breaks from what I'm doing, because thats no issue with the type of work I do, so its not like he isn't interacting with me a lot. \n\nI'm now on maternity leave for a while, and don't need to use the TV and I want to completely move away from the amount of screen time he's been having even when I return to work. He throws tantrums when it goes off, he asks for it constantly, and I feel like I've ruined him. I think the TV is leading to some dysregulation honestly. I'm so upset with myself for allowing the TV to become so central to our days. \n\nI need to move away from it. Is my only option to just rip off the bandaid and deal with the tantrums until he gets over it and moves on from the obsession? Have I ruined him forever? \n\nHas anyone else used the TV too much and come to regret it and turned things around? \nI want to break this cycle and not make the same mistake with my daughter. \n\n\n",

I noticed one day while my husband was putting our almost 4 month old in a FOOTED PJ’s WITH A ZIPPER that he puts his leg in first then his arms. His reasoning, so he doesn’t have to squeeze his legs an uncomfortable way to get him in the onesie.\n\nI, on the other hand, put his arms in first. My reasoning, so that the FOOTED PJ’s WITH A ZIPPER is already on him and I’m not having to worry about fighting to keep his legs inside the onesie.\n\nOnce I noticed how my husband and I do it differently I had other trusted family members put him in a FOOTED PJ’s WITH A ZIPPER. I noticed most of the time the men would do feet first while the women did arms.\n\nWho is ‘right’? We are curious and naturally competitive people so whoever “wins” gets to pick where we eat for dinner. Fingers crossed I win. Your girl is craving some delicious Chinese food!",

        "selftext": "I’m not sure where else to post this, but I was hoping there might be some other parents out there who don’t post their children on socia media.\n\nContext: My husband and I decided when we were pregnant that we didn’t want to post our kids on social media. With the recent advancement of A.I. and all the things people can do with it, disgusted me thinking of what someone could do with a picture of my child if they wanted. I feel very deeply about it.\n\nAnyway, we told our families during pregnancy multiple times we won’t be posting and we don’t want anyone else to either. So far everyone’s done well with that rule of ours. Except yesterday night, my mom posted a picture with her and all the grandkids together. I don’t have social media myself so my husband let me know. It’s the middle of the night so I will have to talk to her in the morning. Thought maybe I could get a couple responses by then to help me navigate the situation.\n\nOn one side, I feel so deeply about protecting my children. On the other side, my mom is my absolute favorite person in the whole world and I feel like I’m about to steal her joy away and hurt her feelings and I’m really struggling to push myself to do that. I know her heart is good and she’s just forgetting our rule. I know she’s so proud and loves all her grandkids so much. So this is so difficult for me.\n\nI’m not looking for advice on posting my kids on social media because truly I don’t believe there’s any convincing me the bad doesn’t exist, so really I guess I’m looking for maybe some words of encouragement, affirmation I’m doing the right thing, or how to navigate the situation best since I know I’m about to hurts some feelings.\n\nEdit: Talked to my mom this morning! All is good! She did in fact forget which is what I assumed. She told me to never apologize for protecting my children and that SHE was sorry I even had to remind her. She deleted it! Thanks everyone!",

I see examples like giving game-like instructions, making songs/chants for routines, using silly conversations to work through emotion regulation, etc. My brain just isn't creative like that I guess 😂 to teach my kid (5F) I've largely been able to rely on just straight teaching in a kind and joyful attitude, making sure I'm showing or saying things in a way she understand.\n\n  \nOne thing I haven't been able to teach her is blowing her nose. No matter what we did she just couldn't (or didn't want to) figure out how to push air out with force. This morning I could hear in her breathing that one side of her nose was clogged with a fatty glob of mucous that was too high up to be manually extracted, and all of a sudden 💡\n\n  \nI propped up a piece of tissue on my hand and I said, \"Close your mouth and blow air out your nose to make the ghost fly!\" She lit up, gave it a try, and actually \\*kept trying\\* instead of giving up as she tends to do. After a few attempts, she finally manage to blow the tissue off my hand and out came the fatty glob. So gross but so satisfying!\n\n  \nWhat are some ways you've successfully gameified your kids into learning new skills?",

Right, wrong or indifferent snow and ice completely shuts us down. We’re talking 9 days of unexpected school closures. \n\nMy child’s birthday was right before all of this and he expressed his desire for a party at the last minute. Originally we were planning to take one friend to an attraction about 45 minutes away. Right before I texted the other parent asking if he could come my child said he would rather have several friends at something closer. At the time I said no problem I’ll work on it, and within a couple days we got the news that the bad ice storm was coming and we needed to prep for 5 days w/o power. Needless to say that took all my energy and focus.   Because of this- relatives/friends who normally send physical gifts just sent money or Amazon GC which we haven’t spent yet. So the only gifts he physically received were a few small things from us (his parents). Part of the problem is bday being so close to Christmas there just isn’t a whole lot left he really wants. \n\nNow he is saying he really wants that party. My question is- what should I do?  Has the moment passed? Is it weird to host a bday party 6-8 weeks after the fact? \n\nAnyway, I didn’t get the sense from my child that he was ungrateful and I am glad he talked to me about his feelings. It just did not go the way he wanted which I totally understand that disappointment. ",

My daughter just turned 2yo and she has always been an early riser at 5-5:40am. \n\nWe only have two bedrooms so our children sleep in the same room. It hasn't been as big of an issue until recently because my son could still take an afternoon nap. However, from this year, he's started preschool and does not get to nap during the day. He's so exhausted he falls asleep on the way home from his preschool in the car and ends up staying up later than my daughter because of that power nap. \n\nI feel like we're stuck in an unsustainable rut and it is to the detriment of my son. My husband and I are even thinking about sleeping in the living room and giving up our bedroom to one of the kids to separate them. \n\nDoes anyone have any other tips for us to try before we resort to that?\n\nEDIT: thank you for the support and advice! Some further information as to why we haven't gone down the cosleeping route - I have epilepsy and it would not be safe for the baby to be in the bed. An active toddler kicking around in our bed would also likely trigger my epilepsy so it's a no go either way.\n\nI also feel like bringing one of them into our room might give the impression of playing favourites. \n\nMy son has autism. Routine is really important to him so I would prefer to adjust our routines as parents or my daughter's instead of his.\n\nMy daughter is his little shadow and adores her brother. So her trying to wake up my son is more out of love and a desire to play with him than malice or her trying to annoy him.\n\nI just want to fast-forward to a time when my daughter can sleep until 6:30-7am 😭😭😭😭",

This year we’ll go to the Peppa Pig house (he loooooves PP), followed by some good food and a few other activities. It’s easier to plan since it’s during the school break.\n\nHe loves birthday parties, and I never turn down an invite, so I feel bad about not returning the favor. I’ve casually mentioned to some of his friends’ parents that if we ever had a party, they’d be at the top of the list—but we’re not throwing one this year.\n\nThe thought of the logistics makes me itch. First, I’m completely on my own—no other parent, relatives, or close friends to help. Where we live there’s no need to drive, but that actually makes delivery of decorations and supplies more complicated. Our place is also too tiny to host.\n\nThere is, of course, the option of an all-inclusive package where you don’t have to bring anything, but it’s pricey—around $1,000. At this age I’d want to invite his whole class (about 20 kids) plus some friends from his older school, so we’d be talking about roughly 30 people including parents. Even with a party host, the thought feels overwhelming.\n\nMy son would love a party, but so far he’s been understanding and appreciative of other ways we celebrate and have fun.\n\nWe’ll still make cute goodie bags for the kids in his class.  \nI just wish I had more energy, more resources, and some sort of village lol.\n\nI can’t stop feeling guilty.",

If it’s just “annoying” for adults, I don’t consider that a great reason to block if it’s otherwise fine. \n\nI’ll go first: \n- boss baby\n- any Larva show\n- grizzly and the lemmings \n- cocomelon \n- booba\n- cuphead show \n\nBefore the majority of comments are “how do you block shows on Netflix?!” Here’s how:\n1. On your desktop or mobile browser (not the app), login. \n2. Click account \n3. Scroll over to “profiles”, click it. \n4. Select the profile you want to manage \n5. Select adjust parental controls \n6. Scroll down past the rating options, type your title in the search bar under “title restrictions for ___” \n7. Go to town! \n\nETA: we don’t give them free reign of the remote, but, if you’re a parent you likely know (and dread) the battle of them seeing a show on the menu that they can’t watch. Plus, this is more foolproof for babysitters and grandparents. ",

We’ve never hit our kids, we take responsibility for when we’re in the wrong, and allow our kid to explore within clearly defined boundaries. My kid has chores around the house and a part time job so they are familiar with responsibility. \n\nYet they have zero ambition for anything, they are becoming more extreme in their views almost venturing into nihilism, and doesn’t see the appeal of going to even more school (university), getting a mindless job to contribute to the capitalist machine, and eventually dying due to pollution and/or climate change .\n\nWhere are other parents in all this?

        "selftext": "My daughter, E \\[7\\] has a friend, K \\[7\\] in her class that lives across the street from us. Her friend has a little sister, S, who’s newly five. They are not as well off as we are (yes this matters for the post). Now, she’s generally a very sweet girl, but she doesn’t listen very well. She also breaks things almost every time she’s over, and does not leave my cats alone. I don’t believe the breaking things is malicious, she’s just not very mindful, she’s 5.\n\nOk so my daughter and her friend, K, have sleepovers often. The first time I let S stay as there were more girls than just my daughter and K. The second time her mom expected her to stay again making it an odd number. I had to explain that odd numbers with young girls is never a good idea. I also just really didn’t want to deal with a younger child that doesn’t listen, and needs more support than the almost 8 year olds. Thankfully, her mom understood, and ended up taking S home with her.\n\nNow this is where I get annoyed. Her mom won’t let K do anything else without S. I want to take K and E to an indoor playground? The mom and S have to come. I want to take K and E shopping? The mom and S have to come. I want to take K and E out to eat? The mom and S have to come.\n\nK’s birthday is in two weeks, and her and E want to go to an indoor theme park. I bought two tickets already. The mom is insisting I bring S, she said she’d pay for her ticket, but she still owes me $20 from the last outing we went on. The mom chose a china buffet for us to eat at, and then once we’re there, she expected me to pay for everyone! She didn’t tell me before we were in line so $80 later, I ask her to reimburse me because wtf? She has not paid me the other half yet and that was a week and a half ago.\n\nAlright, so a ticket to the theme park is $55. S also isn’t tall enough to ride the big kid rides. Three is an odd number, and I don’t think the girls should have to ride baby rides. I’m afraid that if the mom and S do come, that I’ll be stuck paying for S’s food and treats and stuff too because I know the mom can’t afford any of that. I feel like I’ll end up being put on the spot to pay for everything. It’s also annoying because there are going to be endless instances where they have to do things separately. Why is this time such a big deal? K should be allowed autonomy on her birthday. I just do not feel obligated to include S, and it’s frustrating for both big girls to constantly have a young annoying sibling hanging on them.\n\nHow do I handle this respectfully, considering this is a birthday gift. Would you feel obligated to always include your kid’s friend’s younger sibling?\n\nEdit: K is my daughter’s friend. It is K’s birthday present, not my daughter’s. An unlimited wristband is not an odd thing to gift where we live. I know her mom is overall fine with her going just from past casual conversations. It’s the fact she keeps trying to push her other kid onto me at various times.\n\nYes, her and I are somewhat “friends”. I’m trying not to get too close because it seems as though she asks me for a favor every encounter I have with her.",

        "selftext": "To preface, we've only been adoptive parents for two years and our girls are 12 and 10. We didn't really get to grow into this role so playdates, birthday parties, sleepovers, friendships - we're kind of trainwrecking these things and don't know what the 21st century expectations and conventions are.\n\nFirst question is about sleepovers: I hear a lot of people aren't comfortable with them anymore? They do \"sleep unders\" now where kids hang out late and then parents come and pick everybody up, but this is only something I've read about. Is this a real thing?\n\nThe second question is, what do you do if you're the only male in the house? Do you make yourself scarce and go do something else? I at least planned on taking our younger daughter and doing something else so she's not in the way of her older sister and her friends. I feel a little uncomfortable being the only male here with a bunch of young girls - but am I making it weird by feeling that it's weird? God knows kids need good male role models so I feel like sticking around, but out of the way, is a fine thing to do.\n\nAnyway, sorry if this is all over the place. But I feel like I'm still a newish parent. Our girls are adjusted to the point where we're comfortable with them doing more things and we want to provide these fun experiences for them. But I just don't know what things are like now and I always feel awkward asking the parents I barely know of my kids' friends \"hey, how does this kids hanging out together thing work, tell me everything.\"\n\nEDIT: I have a memory of reading a post where everybody was categorically agreeing that Dad should dip from the girls' sleepover and that being around would be weird. I guess it just kinda spooked me. Thanks ya'll.",

Since the moment my daughter was born, my mom, who is now 77 years old and lives by herself, has been begging my wife and I to let her spend time with our daughter without either of us. She says it always feels like she is being supervised when she comes over our house and plays with our daughter either in the yard, the playroom, or her bedroom, even though my wife and I leave them completely alone while we do other things around the house. I also bring my daughter to my mom’s house pretty much weekly after school and they play by themselves while I go in a separate room and finish my work for the day, so it’s just the two or them for at least a couple hours. My mom is a loving person but she is quite careless and clumsy, and I’ve had several conversations with her about not wanting to leave our daughter alone with her because what if something ever happened to her (my mom) while they were alone together- what would my 4 year old do? None of us have landlines, our daughter can’t unlock a smartphone and call for help, and I’d NEVER want to put her in that situation, as improbable as it may be. But every couple of months my mom asks again when she can spend some alone time with our daughter. I’ve been kind but firm about this boundary yet she keeps asking. Is this weird? Do all single grandparents behave this way?",

I’m sorry I don’t have time to reply individually to everyone! \n\nI told her no iPad at least for rest of week. She sobbed 30 min but was fine after I walked the dog. She’s acting mainly contrite now but tomorrow will be grumpy (of course this happens the week my husband is travelling for work!)\n\nIt’s complicated but we need her to still have a key just on Tuesdays. It’s Good News Club which has consistently said she prefers to regular afterschool (it wouldn’t be our first choice, but she said the snacks are better). We just moved her to only one day a week of afterschool and otherwise I work from home MWF. So if my husband is unavailable, she is walking home and being at home for 15 min before I get there, or 30 min before my High Schooler gets dropped off. So while taking away the key is a great suggestion, it’s not workable for Tuesdays.\n\nScreen time - she’s absolutely addicted even though it’s already limited (30 min on/ 60 min off; off for good at 7pm, and a 24 hour family tech sabbath on weekends). She’s an introverted kid and her best friend moved away, so they play a lot of games together and I bet she was hoping to catch her friend after school. I am absolutely contemplating reducing it even further (I had warned them over Christmas that this was likely). \n\nRe the teacher - I’m thankful to those who suggested a handwritten apology. Done! The teacher emailed me, I saw it and replied not to let her unless she really believed the headache story (I didn’t/don’t), but she let her go before checking the reply. She knows we love close and she walks home MWF, but yes, she should have waited for written consent (I already know she feels badly about that). \n\n—-\n\nOriginal Post: \n\nMy 10-year-old just lied to her teacher saying that I said she could skip the afterschool program and walk home. She has a house key because I was going to get home 10 minutes later than her.\n\nI know she lied and the teacher know she lied and this is not the first time she's been caught in a lie to the same teacher. There's no natural consequence for this except for the disappointment of her parents and teacher which doesn't seem to make a difference. Is taking away her iPad for the week reasonable or unreasonable? Should I also ground her – keep her from playing outside?. Does anyone have any other advice? Please?!",

        "selftext": "Edit: thank you for all the feedback fellow parents! We’ve decided since it wasn’t intentional, just a dumb mistake, and he was truly sorry, we won’t require him to “pay/ earn” anything. We’re going to bring him to the board meeting next week and have him apologize. Then he’s going to help sweep up the court and keep it tidy so that when the new hoop is installed, it will be clean and ready for the whole neighborhood to enjoy.\n\nMy son is 10. He was practicing basketball at the neighborhood goals down the road. His brother rushed home on his bike to tell me that he threw a rock and broke the backboard. I started to walk down there to check it out. I saw my 10 year old heading up the road on foot. He was immediately full of true remorse. He knew throwing rocks was not a good decision and that he shouldn’t ever be throwing them. In his mind, he thought a rock would be lighter and easier to make a 3 point goal. We notified the neighborhood HOA and plan to pay for it. I explained to my son that he made a poor decision without thinking of the consequences, and that in life accidents like this may happen but that we need to be good people and do the right thing always.\n\nWhere I need advice is, how do we get him to pay for the replacement? Of course we will pay the neighborhood for it immediately and have our son pay us back. He doesn’t get an allowance and he is already responsible for regular chores. These glass backboards however cost upwards of $1000 or more. It would take a long time for a ten year old to make that amount.\n\nMy husband and I talked about maybe taking it out of his “eating out budget.” We go out to eat a few nights a week so that may help him earn the money. We also talked about extra chores outside his regular chores to pay for it, but again, that seems minuscule. He does service work in the community already, but should we make him choose extra service work and pay him hourly for it?\n\nShould we make him pay half and we cover the other half—our own consequence for letting him play unsupervised? (For the record, I fully believe in letting children have unsupervised play but these are the kind of things that can happen.)\n\nAlso, should we make this process more formal for him by taking him to a board meeting to explain to the board members  what happened and apologize to them in person and accept responsibility? They could explain to him the work that has to be done on their end to take care of this.\n\nIf you read all of this, thank you and I’m open to all ideas and advice!",

He’s getting short and aggressive about it and has said he’s going to bring it into the house anyway.\n\nFor clarity: I’m not saying he can’t have the bike. I’m saying it needs to be stored and worked on somewhere appropriate, shed, storage unit, friend’s place, etc. But we don’t have a garage, and he bought it without a proper plan for where it would go.\n\nThis feels like it’s turning into a power struggle, but I also don’t think I should have to accept a motorbike rebuild in my living room to keep the peace.\n\nAm I being unreasonable here, or is this a normal boundary to hold in a shared home?\n\nHow would you handle this, especially when the other parent is undermining the boundary?",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I've got a bit of a family situation going on here and I am looking for some advice. I have a blended family and right now my 17-year-old is being quite difficult. He is given a small amount of chores per week which he has not been doing. Now I have given him the choice to choose his chores and also a consequence if he does not complete them. I floated the idea of him losing his internet connection as a consequence for not getting his chores done, at which point he threatened to move in to his mom's place if I do that because he won't be able to do his school work. I made clear that I would still allow him to do his school work and filter out other aspects of his connection, however, the simple fact that he made this threat to me has me quite alarmed and quite upset. I feel like he is taking me hostage in my own home. I'm wondering how to handle this. In a way it doesn't seem reasonable or logical to lose my relationship with him over chores, but at the same time it feels like he is trying to take away all of my power as his parent and it's a slippery slope. Any advice in terms of how to handle this delicate situation would be appreciated. Thanks!",

It will be a financial burden if we decide to do it and the logistics will be a problem, leaving just 2-3 hours daily to spend together as a family. But I am really keen on the idea and I have been trying to implement montessori practices at home since birth. \n\n\n\nSo parents of adults or older children, who were going to Montessori pre school, do you think it was worth it? Do you see major differences in the way your children think compared to other people? Are they more independent and better critical thinkers? I'm really looking forward to hear your opinions!",

Shortly after he was born, my MIL asked for his social security number to open an account for him. At the time, I asked my husband to hold off because we had just gotten home from a long stay in the hospital (I had lots of complications post delivery). Now she is has been asking more frequently and for some reason, I am just not comfortable with it.\n\nI have tried to process why - I know it’s common for grandparents to set up accounts for their grandkids. I have discussed with my husband and maybe it is because I don’t know any details of the account or what else would be done with the social security number (what kind of account, how many, etc.) I can’t help but think of some of the unknown tax implications or weird financial control that could develop. Part of me also thinks this just may be how I am processing feelings of my son being in the NICU and I am taking out frustration/anger on this instead.\n\nOverall I just want some feedback - do other parents have hesitations about sharing personal information like SS# with grandparents or is this very common and appropriate?",

He kept procrastinating and asked to wait until I’d finalized the English books. When the deadline arrived, he didn’t follow up at all — I had to check in and ask whether he’d even completed the order. Only after I asked did he do it.\n\nAfter that, I still had to remind him to transfer the money to the school and inform them. His response was that I should transfer the money first and he’d pay me back later. When I take my thoughts on why can’t he just do it from start to finish (fill up form > make payment > put the form in the bag), he got annoyed and told me I needed to stop nagging. \n\nWhat really got to me was that later that night, I had to remind him to put the form into our child’s school bag. He procrastinated and replied that since I was sending our child to school the next day, I could just do it. It felt like yet another small task being shifted back to me.\n\nI’m not upset about doing things for my child — I’m exhausted by having to constantly remember, prompt, follow up, and manage everything. Has anyone else dealt with this imbalance in mental load? How do you handle them all?\n\nI am already the one keeping track of my child’s progress, classmates, emotions, attending all these school meetings, school excursions on my own and needing to remind my husband to block his calendar just for our son’s concert. All these just adds on to me feeling like a single married mum making me drained and very resentful. Counselling doesn’t seem to help if an individual isn’t willing to be more responsible. \n\nAny practical advise?",

We have started a mini book club reading books together and we just finished the first Harry Potter book and plan to continue the series.\n\nMy question is, as he grows, what are some books you have read that really highlight and show positive masculinity. My classic example is from my favorite books, Aragorn from Lord of the Rings. He is kind, gentle, wise, and also a bad ass warrior.\n\nIt does not need to be fiction or even teen level, as I’d love to have a list in my back pocket as he grows up and expands his literary capabilities. My goal is as his father, for us to be able to read and when we talk about them, be able to have conversations where I can slip in things I really admire about these characters, that will hopefully resonate with my son because they are already characters he admires.\n\nAgain, to Aragorn, when we read Lord of Rings, and he gets excited about Aragorn hacking down foes at the Black Gate, I want to be able to say Heck Yeah! That was awesome! And also, I love how as a king after the battle of Minas Tirith he healed and cares for the wounded.\n\nTLDR: What are your favorite examples of positive masculinity in literature?

        "selftext": "I just had a conversation with my 6-year-old son that is concerning me. We have family friends with a daughter our son’s age, and they have been good friends for the past 3 years. This year our son is starting to pick on her when they play together and at school. He makes her cry often. But they still say they are best friends. We have tried talking to him many times about this, and said that we just won’t invite her to come over anymore if he is going to act like that with her, but it is hard too because her parents own the company I work at and I would like to stay on good terms with them. Our son is often irritable, hard-headed, and moody, and we are having other behavioural concerns with him, but he also has his moments when he shows kindness. \n\nWe have our son’s class picture on our fridge, and his friend gave us her individual picture so that is on the fridge too. I noticed our son keeps moving the magnets to cover her face in the pictures. I asked him why he’s been doing that and after a long pause he said “I don’t like her face”, which I said was really not nice, seeing as she is his best friend. He said “well it’s true”. I tried to get deeper and asked why he would say that, what he doesn’t like about her face.. and he said “because she’s too happy. I don’t like when people are too happy. It annoys me.” So my question is, what do you think is going on here? I’m concerned because his best friend being happy should make him feel happy, not annoyed. I asked if he feels annoyed because he doesn’t feel happy like they do, and he said that’s not it. So I’m at a loss. :(",

        "selftext": "\\*I meant food I didn’t check before I posted\\*\n\nMy 15 month old doesn’t like mashed potatoes. I’ve tried more textured, less textured, more flavor, more plain. He spits them out 90% of the time. I can sometimes sneak a successful bite if I pair a bite with something he loves like carrots or whatever meat we’re having but over all he just doesn’t like them. I think it’s so weird because he likes potatoes and out of all the foods he loves it’s such a weird one to not like. He likes green olives, plain avocado, pickles among other strongly flavored things. He’ll eat fries, roast potatoes, tator tots, he loves breakfast potatoes cooked with onions and peppers. When ever we have mashed potatoes for dinner I have him try them and I will continue to at least have him try them but I fear im in for a lifetime time of making two different kinds of potatoes when we have them for dinner lol.\n\nWhat food does your kid not like that you think is just a strange hill to die on?",

I took him to the park an hour ago and in between playing he continued his crying spree. On the way back in the car I had a mini meltdown raising my voice telling him “Stop crying all the time! I can’t anymore! All day you cry for absolutely no reason! Why do you love crying so much?! Cry cry cry is what you do from the moment you wake up!” \n\nAnd then he calmly responded “Dada I’m crying cause I’m three”.  \n\nI felt terrible. I apologized to him for raising my voice. I said that “daddy is human too and has feelings and it’s hard to deal with someone who cries all the time. But you are indeed three and it’s not your fault you can’t regulate your feelings”. \n\nHe’s a good kid, I’m just exhausted. ",

        "body": "Posting here since it’s more fitting than where I put it originally,\n\nElizabeth Warren wrote a book on a study she conducted while still at Harvard university.\n\nYou’re more likely to declare bankruptcy as a dual income family than a single income family because you organize your life around dual incomes. Your buying power increases so you buy a bigger house, you buy an extra car, you also have additional fixed costs like childcare. Not to mention if you’re both making around 60k a year the second income is only realistically bringing in around 2k a year due to the raise in fixed costs and the higher tax bracket.\n\nTo actual receive the benefits of dual income you need to only live off one income and only use one income for your buying power (mortgages, loans, etc.). You might have a smaller house and an older car but you’ll be better off financially in the long term.\n\nThis model of the working family is ironically the result of feminism. Back in the 70s a single income could support an entire family but as more and more families became dual income with women becoming more prevalent in the workforce and their buying power increased they were able to outbid single income families artificially increasing the value of the home.\n\nBut that’s just my 2 cents (until the penny is out of rotation that is)",

And it has stemmed one of the most incredulous governments with policies that oppose human nature. You dont hold the environment and its health as a real priority. Look at the mass hunting to near extinction of so many animals here in the Americas. Largest 'untapped wilderness,' this is not the time to drop knowledge like that of Cahokia or The Great Hopewell Road, with reserves of materials once unfathomable to the eurocentric people's, they immediately set to plundering it. Now, look. One giant sprawling shopping mall. Commodification of land truly blows my mind. By separating the land into grids and plots you essentially pit the community against each other. Everyone is in competition with each other. Plus, your language is too muddy. English is a labyrinth of mental hurdles in order to navigate through this life with. And I do believe that is also by design of nefarious ancestors in that lineage. Deceive the people and they will then go on deceiving their self so long as no catalyst happens. Not learning silence is a weakness that is exploited by this culture. Not learning to read signs that do not have words, listening to answers that are never spoken with words. These things do happen but if you are not looking nor listening for it then you will not see nor hear it ever. \nMy tribe is not federally recognized. I am the first of my family to be a homeowner since the trail of tears. I am a father of 3 girls and a veteran of the united states marine corps. Life has not been easy for me. The drugs and drink my people were introduced to, the loss of our culture, our rights, our freedom to live as we see fit, has wrecked generations and generations. My wife hears daily how much I hate grinding away for a paycheck. That it is against the laws of nature and that it, like a masked army proceeding through american cities with full presidential immunity, is also what has led to this orwellian, violence loving, self serving, idiocracy. \nThe only way I have found to combat it is. Spend your money very wisely. Always try to be present as the person you wish to be. Give to the elderly, the young, the poor and burdend. Grow food. Be active in your community. Then, with patience, prudence and love, speak well and intelligently on important subjects such as civics, beliefs and when hearing of another person's. \n\nMy heart is with you. I sincerely pray and push toward a society where my daughters dont have to celebrate my weekends nor wince of sadness that I must head off to work. One of these days, we will be free again.",

        "body": "My son learned this lesson early because I didn't get the chance to. The kids have gotten Chromebook to do homework on since he was in first grade. We helped him pack things up. But by third grade, we told him he has to be responsible for packing his own stuff. \n\nHe forgot his Chromebook for school twice and had a breakdown on the way to school both those times because he was so nervous. Since then, he has not forgotten it. He just turned 13 and makes sure it's plugged in and charged the night before, so it's good for school. He's the first to wake up and the first one ready in the house, even makes his own breakfast. I've been really big about personal responsibility for two reasons: I was babied as a kid because I have a series of disabilities. Im an independent adult now, but I struggled a lot in my 20s with understanding the adult world because of it.  The second reason is because he's a boy, and in the deep south, boys are not taught like girls in household chores and cooking. He does his own laundry and is responsible for his room, unloading the dishes and keeping the living room tidy. It's not much, just vacuuming and keeping the area clutter free. It takes two minutes to clean the room, and he never balks when its time. \n\nI just want to create a functional human being. I also don't want him putting the burden of domestic chores on his future partner.",

        "body": "I'm going to surface something that I don't see mentioned in the comments yet - the mention of 5am. Teenagers have the hardest time getting up in the morning for legit biological reasons. Not because they are lazy or irresponsible.\n\nFirst, their melatonin production is delayed by two hours, meaning if we start feeling sleepy at 9pm, they only start feeling sleepy at 11pm.\nSecond, they still need 8-10hr of sleep every night to be able to function properly - school, academics, sports.\nThird, their bodies basically want to sleep until 8-9am in the morning. Walking up at 5am for them is like waking up at 2am for us. Imagine if you were asked to wake up at 2am every morning?\n\nWhile I understand your concern about your teenager kid learning a hard lesson, I'd approach this from a completely different angle. Talk to them about sleep needs. The school system is not designed to support teenagers' sleep needs - they are all sleep-deprived there, and it affects every system in their body including mental health, concentration, memory, metabolism etc.\n\nInstead of deciding how to force your kid to wake up at 5am, I'd talk about what's the latest your kid can wake up, how to spend the least amount of time on getting ready in the morning so they can sleep more, and how to get to school the fastest. Maybe it's waking up 10min before school starts in school clothes, brushing teeth, no breakfast, nd jumping on a bike to be there in 5min. So they can maximize their sleep.\n\nWork together with your kid on figuring out how to help them. Don't punish them for being a teenager. They are not adults yet, their bodies are not fully developed yet. They are suffering when it comes to sleep, and can't really control it.",

Yes, he will cry. He will be fine. \n\nSame for cooking, or get a wrap and learn to use it correctly. This helped SO MUCH for things like housework and going to the grocery store. (This was before pick-up was a thing...so if you can, just do pickup and avoid the store altogether, lol.) \n\nPersonally, I got a \"camping bassinet\" or something from a friend and this thing was a lifesaver because I just scooted it next to my bed and laid down on the edge so that I could put my arm in the bassinet and have physical contact with my son. It also made feeding and putting him back while he slept in a milk drink state a lot easier. \n\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, OP. Your husband sounds like he was an amazing person. Please reach out to what support system you have. And be PERSISTENT about it. Do not accept, \"you are SO STRONG, *YOU GOT THIS.\"* And if that's all you get... contact the facility where he was born (this stupid sub will not allow me to name the type of facility where people go when they are born or when they are in need of care 🙄🙄🙄🙄) where he was born to see if they can give any resources. Or maybe social services. \n\nThat's it. I wanted to say more but some of the rules of this sub are not allowing me to use proper terminology and I'm absolutely over it rn. ✌️✌️✌️",

The newborn phase is exhausting and you get little sleep, but it doesn’t last forever. There is a safe way to cosleep and that’s what I’ve done for both my kids (pregnant with my 3rd now). They didn’t seem to love the bassinet/crib.\n\nI recommend reaching out to all family/friends for help. Someone to come over for an hour or two to keep you company/let you shower. You need a village right now. Keep meals simple. Put baby in a bouncer in the bathroom with you. Remember, you can’t spoil a baby. Baby wear when you need to and sometimes just hanging out on the couch is the biggest thing you’ll do all day. Lots of snuggles. Give yourself lots of grace.",

He has a save sleep device and everything he really needs as far as stuff goes. The home is safe. I just am scared they will look at how tired and overwhelmed I am and try to take the only thing I have left. I can’t loose my son. We only have each other. My family lives out of state for the most part. Except my mom who was emotionally abusive growing up and is pretty mentally unfit to be left with any child. I can’t let her watch my son unfortunately. My husbands family offered to let me move in with them. They live 3000 miles away though and I’d have to move with a newborn on top of all this other stuff. Long term I want to do that but right this moment I’m not sure how to get started on that when I can barely get everything done now. The neighbor lady offered to help me watch him but I don’t know her well. Maybe the hospital can give me a list of childcare providers that I could trust to watch him in my home for me while I rest.

One piece of advice I heard (and I have no idea if it’s true or not but it doesn’t matter) is you really only need 4 hours of sleep a night to make it the next day.  So push on through the bad nights/days.  Stop thinking about how tired you are.  It will get so much better.  I promise, it will.  If you breastfeed keep doing it.  8 weeks is when it went from “is this worth the misery” to “this is so convenient and easier than bottles”.  But also if you plan on daycare give them a bottle once a day so they’re used to taking a bottle.  Also take the baby out for a walk.  It will help them sleep and give you some sanity and exercise to feel better.  I was so stressed the baby would start crying I did loops around the neighborhood so I would always be close to home.  \n\nEdit: more.  Cooking: I cooked the entire time.  Strapped her to me in the front for cold stuff.  But her on my back or waited until she was napping for hot stuff.  I wasn’t busting out gourmet meals.  Eggs.  Refried beans.  Salads.  Sauteed spinach.  \n\nShower: I started a routine since she was born and at four years old we still do it.  I am fortunate to have a shower next to a bath tub in my master suite.  So I set her up in the bath and bathe her.  Then pop her in her crib with the mobile going and take a quick shower.  Sometimes she cried.  It’s ok.  Let her cry a few minutes while you finish showering.  She hasn’t cried for ages now and I can shower while she bathes and I can watch her the whole time through the glass.  Maybe you can set up a small bath in your shower if you don’t have such a set up?  \n\nHighly recommend a wrap.  She wouldn’t nap so I’d strap her to me and go on walks and hikes and she would nap then.  \n\nI never was able to get her to sleep in the bassinet.  If you can find some sort of side car sleeper next to your bed I’d recommend that.  \n\nI built our garden while she was a baby!  I’d set her up on a towel in the backyard and I built garden beds and set up trellises while she watched.  It worked in 20 min intervals.  \n\nYou can do this!  If you have the means feel free to hire help.  Even just a helper while you go for a walk solo or take a shower.  I didn’t have the means so I just tried my best.  \n\nI’m so sorry for your loss.",

Ask them for whatever you need, whether that’s “I need you to bring me a hot meal to eat” or “I need you to hold the baby so I can sleep for a few hours” or “I need you to do a load of laundry.” In the early weeks, even with a spouse, we lived off of doordash and grubhub gift cards. We also used Hungryroot for a while because it was so simple, usually just heat and serve, no chopping or anything. And it was good and we could also order some extra grocery stuff to come with the delivery. If you have the funds for it, I’d look into a postpartum doula. Even like one night a week for a few weeks would probably make such a difference for you. For sleep, could you consider safe co-sleeping? And for shower, bring baby in with you if you have to. They might actually like it. Or bring a bouncer and put it next to the shower so you can comfort as needed. Deep breaths. You are in the trenches and it feels hard because it is.",

        "body": "You poor thing. You’ve had to endure so much. I am so sorry for your loss and for having to survive new motherhood without support while grieving. You must be unimaginably strong to have gotten through these few weeks so far. \n\nThe good news is: the first month or so is when it feels impossible to do anything else because they seem so fragile and new to us. I remember insisting that one person could not be watching my newborn AND opening the door for a dog to go outside. But very soon, the baby will be less fragile and you will be more confident in maneuvering baby without harm. You discover you can hold the baby in the shower if you have a wash cloth wrapped around baby to make them less slippery. You discover the right floor rocker/container that baby likes and set them safely in the kitchen while you cook. Soon you will find a rhythm with baby that works enough. It probably won’t be perfect and it will still be a challenge but it will work enough that you feel confident you can make it. You’ll get just enough sleep and shower and eat just enough to feel human and you’ll see the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nAnd after that it will continue to get easier. It might be hard to deal with toddler tantrums but when you know that your child can sit and play on the floor safely beside you while you do something, it does unlock the ability to care for yourself a bit more. \n\nAgain, I’m so sorry for your loss. But you and little one will get through this together and your son will know his mom was superwoman and that his mom’s love for him helped weather a tremendous storm.\n\nEdit: also want to add that I see people recommending reaching out for help from ANYONE you can and I just want to emphasize that those people will be happy to receive your call. No matter who they are. Even a distant coworker that knows you’ve lost your husband while trying to be a new mom would get that text from you asking for them to come over while you shower and they’d be grabbing keys and out the door before reaching the end of the text. I’ve even seen it myself. An attorney in the area was going through something similar and all attorneys that ever practiced in the same court were taking shifts at her house. These are people that she had opposed in court. The closest equivalent to enemies and they didn’t think twice about being there for her. So don’t think twice about asking for help.",

        "body": "I’m so sorry to hear of your loss and understand personally how hard grief and newborns are. I truly hope that you will be able to get the much needed rest you deserve soon. \n\nWhen I’m feeling desperate for sleep with my newborn I do the following: I change her diaper and get her nice and swaddled while her bottle is warming up. Then I lay her down in her bassinet. I have her regular sound machine going and the Baby Shusher sound machine going at the same time. The shusher will turn off on its own, but the shush sound is very comforting. I feed her the bottle while she is in the bassinet so that way when she falls asleep eating she doesn’t need to be moved and has a dry diaper. Have your baby laying on their side while eating, so you only have to roll them very slowly to their back once they finish eating. Thankfully my daughter doesn’t spit up much, but that can be a concern with some babies. I just clean her up if she spits up. It’s not a good sleep method for consistent use. As you typically need to burp babies and keep them upright after feeding. But it helps the baby go to sleep happy and comfortable and hopefully you can get some sleep or shower. Have a pacifier ready to give baby when the bottle is finished to help keep them happy and asleep. You can also put a crib vibration pad (or anything that vibrates) in the bassinet to help with soothing. \n\nI know in the US it is strongly advised to not co sleep, but I do think it can be a safer option in some situations. Parents that are so sleep deprived, that they risk nodding off while holding their baby in an unsafe sleep position, is far scarier than a parent who is actively following safe co-sleep guidelines. I think it’s better to minimize as much risk as possible, than to chance a worse situation. Your body is still healing from birth at six weeks and grief is exhausting. Sleep is so important for both mom and baby. \n\nI’m not sure if money is an issue for you, and hate to suggest spending money on even more baby items than you already have (see if there are children/baby consignment shops in your area), but without your husband you may find help with different baby items. Baby swings can be very helpful for some babies. Swings that vibrate and have the option to swing side to side or forward to back are nice. Some babies have a preference on swing direction. If you are breastfeeding you may not want your baby to use a pacifier, but pacifiers can help a baby stay asleep. You may need to try more than one type of pacifier to find one your baby likes. Some babies, like my first born, don’t like pacifiers, so that is a possibility too. You may want to try different types of swaddles. You can also put a shirt that smells like you underneath baby’s head in the bassinet. Both of my kids were premature and in the nicu. The nicu had me wear special pieces of cloth in my bra so they could put it next to my baby’s head in the nicu bassinet. The smell is very comforting for them. \n\nIf you need to cook while wearing your baby, but an apron on over the carrier to help protect them. \n\nI recently learned of a postpartum app called Beacon and it connects moms with other moms that are up and awake at the same time during the night. I haven’t used it yet, but I plan to. It sounds like a good place to find connection with other parents in the same stage of life as you. I figured it might be worth mentioning. \n\nBest of luck.",

Im not saying like go out on the town every weekend or anything, but you definitely need and deserve a shower and food! It is totally ok for babies to be left to cry for 10 minutes. As long as you can still hear him and go to him if he actually does need you, it's FINE. Healing will just take time. It will be a long journey but you will make it out.

And be sure they’re teaching the correct lesson: no, we aren’t obligated to consider others before ourselves or place their emotions above our own needs.

        "body": "i would definitely have not one, but several conversations about this. Not because it isnt true—pretty privilege is a fact if life—but because failure to recognize that a person can be pretty, and also unkind, insincere, and all around unpleasant to be around, is an important lesson.\n\nPrettiness doesn’t dictate what a person is like inside, and I feel like kids need to understand this early on. It would save a great many people from heartache. \n\nWhat he said shouldn’t be punished because it IS a reality, and recognizing realities is important. He realized this all on his own. Ok then.\n\nHe DOES need to hear that it was not ta tactful, and that just because its true, doesnt mean it needs to be said out loud. “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.”\n\nAll of these things are super important lessons.\n\nHere’s another one, which I think is important for BOTH of you to remember: “pretty” is subjective. \n\nOne person might love a certain type of look, and another be entirely put off by it. Your husband probably thinks you’re the sexiest woman alive, and that’s no lie. To him, you are. There’s billions of people on the planet. If only 1% think you’re hot as fuck, that’s still more than 80 MILLION people that think you’re a smokeshow. \n\nIf only 1/100 of a percent of the population think you’re hot, that’s STILL almost 1 million people.\n\nSo, to me, there’s three things that need to be addressed, and on more than one occasion:\n\n1) you may not find me pretty, but I do, and not that it matters, but plenty of others do too. Same as some people mind not find you physically attractive someday, but others will. Looks are like colors or foods. Everyone has their favorite. And anyone’s thoughts on the matter are not fact, but opinion.\n\n2) regardless of that, what you said isnt nice. Telling people you dont like something about their appearance, especially something they cant easily change, like a shirt before they leave the house, is generally hurtful, even if the person shouldnt care about your opinion. It doesnt reflect something bad about them, but about the person saying it. The person saying it is acting uncaring, tactless, and classless. So if you would rather come off as a tactfull, classy person, dont say shit like that.\n\n3) be careful about judging others on their looks. Plenty of men and women have fallen in love with pretty only to have their lives destroyed by terrible people. [insert stories of real people; Ted Bundy is always a good one]\n\nAnd people that are not traditionally seen as good looking can be wonderful people that end up shining up the place and being who everyone wants to be around.\n\nBeware. ",

I often have it on in the background when I'm puzzling, crocheting, cleaning, whatever.  In the 60s, *so many crazy things happened*: assassination of a sitting president, assassination of the assassin on live TV.  Then the murder (tired of spelling out the \"a\" word.  lol so many \"s\") of RFK and MLK Jr.  Civil rights unrest, the Vietnam draft, Cuban missile crises, and that's not even getting into women's rights. \n\nI was sexually assaulted around 1979, at the age of 5.  At that time, police flat out told my parents: You can file a report, but then your kid has to relive everything in court.   So it was just dropped.  As far as I know, absolutely *nothing* happened to the babysitter's home business, or her husband who perpetrated the crime.  It's just how it was back then. \n\nI'm not saying all this to be like \"hey the world is allllllldoom and gloom!!!\" because like you I have struggled with bringing life into it as well (my kids are 18 and 22, so on top of the current shithole administration doing all they can to deny things like basic public health and global warming, I worry all the time about AI making their lives even more miserable) BUT!  like Mr. Rogers said, look for the good people.  They're there.  There are people doing kind, generous, marvelous things every single day.   Grab onto those stories and hold them tight.  \n\nCorny as it sounds, We the People *do* have a voice.  I've been happy to see that no matter what shit is thrown at the wall, people are NOT being distracted from the Epstein files.  It's up to all of us to make sure it stays in the spotlight, so that justice may one day be served.",

It doesn't take any stretch of the imagination to understand that rich men (and some women) did the same things to young girls and boys as what my father did to my mother, or that because they are rich, they did much worse things and covered them up, or that because there continues to be zero consequences, the abuse and trafficking of girls and boys and young men and women continues today. My dad was poor, so my mom and dad got married with a sheriff nearby to arrest him if the marriage didn't go through, but none of the Epstein victims had even that little bit of protection.",

Don’t let her/him off the hook.  Context may be pretty important. \nMy daughter (now 28) was 5  when a yard duty lady told her she should not wear “ clothes that represent satan!”\nIt was a white and gold hoodie that had a few skulls (pink) and the skulls had gold bows. It was super cute. My daughter was crying hysterically when I got there 20 min later, after she went to the office to ask to go home . My daughter attended Sunday school and church so she knew that satan was very bad!  It took me 20 min of talking to find out what happened. I was so upset. I talked politely to the principal and asked that the yard duty come in and explain what she said. The woman came in and seemed to double down on the demonic hoodie. She started to rip in to me about what a horrible mom I was and someone should call cps on me. I looked at the principal and watched her bring her hand up to her head and just start to shake her head. I stood up and said “ I will be filing a formal complaint, if she is on this campus longer than it takes for her to get her purse I will file a lawsuit. The principal said “ don’t worry, she is on leave effective immediately pending a formal investigation.” She was fired with cause and my daughter wore that hoodie til she outgrew it. We still have it.",

I’m guessing the teacher said something slightly different.\n\nYes, you’re overreacting. “Huh” and “interesting” and “okay” with a bit of a laugh are what id have said. I don’t teach, but coach, around this age range, and I hear a lot of wild things. \n\nThat statement could’ve been something else or referred to a million different things.

I'd either pop in one morning or send an email (which is nice for a papertrail) and just say, \"Hey Ms/Mr X. RowyourbeauJr came home yesterday a little upset about her shirt. She said that TA told her it was time for her to retire it, and I wanted to figure out if there's a problem with the shirt or if maybe RowyourbeauJr misunderstood what they were trying to say.\"\n\nIf you get a satisfactory answer, just reply with, \"ok, thanks for the clarification. I thought maybe it was just a crossed wire.\" If not, then go from there, and don't be afraid to tap in the principal if you think it's needed. \n\nIn all likelihood, if you ask the teacher, the teacher will say something to the TA and make it clear it's not ok to say those things. This could be a teaching moment where the TA just wasn't thinking, or this could be an issue the needs to be addressed. \n\nDon't EVER be afraid to go to your administration. They can't fire you. They can't kick your kid out of school. Now, I'm not saying to be one of those bitchy moms that that has a tantrum anytime they don't get their way, but absolutely start getting ok with advocating for you and your kid. I'm not being critical. I know it's hard, especially when you're not a very outgoing person. I had to fake it until I made it, but it was worth it.",

There is no reason you have to hear the baby screaming as you’re trying to soothe the baby that really would like nothing more than to sing you the song of their people.  You do everything you need to do to survive! \n\nI helped raise my brother, am a former nanny and work daycare now.  I’ve run my own 4 baby infant room, corun an 8 baby room, had several purple criers (my specialty), had several babies with GI issues (including ones who spit up every feeding and had to be kept upright at least 15 minutes after every feed), had one kid who screamed virtually all day since birth and then his sister who managed to out scream him (mom and dad said after him they weren’t having more because he screamed so much, then had his sister thinking there was no way it could be worse- he napped dependably since infancy, his sister not only screamed but only ever took 15 minute naps, she’s also one of my favorite kids I’ve ever been privileged to help raise, and I adore her brother too), and the works.\n\nBased off reading down thread, I highly recommend a Baby Bjorn if you can swing it (a knockoff is fine too).  You can multitask — get your 10 minutes free of baby, and baby can go in there while you cry in the shower 🤣 if he pukes, he’s upright and safe!  You can keep peeking out of the shower to check on him.  It’s okay to shower while he’s safe with you sitting right outside of it.  Maybe the sound of the shower will even soothe him?  \n\nThese are the babies I hold, walk with, pat their bums while walking, sometimes give a bit of a bounce or jiggle (or bounce in my step), talk quietly to describing everything we’re passing in the room, do a baby reset (strip them down, redo the diaper even if dry, redress (maybe even in a different sleeper, maybe inside out if I think the seams may be bothering them), restart fresh, more walking.  \n\nBabies, evolutionarily, prefer when you stand and walk with them over you sitting and rocking them.  They can tell.  Don’t ask me how, but they can.  It’s a holdover from ancient times when if early people were on the move they were being hunted and baby better sleep and be quiet, being still meant safety and awake time.  Apparently we as a species haven’t evolved past liking this (we haven’t evolved to like nesting as babies even despite doing that for how many ages now? lol) \n\nBabies like movement.  No shame in putting the baby in a bouncer chair like the Bjorne (or knockoff) or fisher price rockers if the baby likes them and having the toddler rock/bounce the baby gently while you supervise and work if the baby takes to that (sometimes another tiny human face does the trick) or in using a baby swing (no sleeping there, but entertaining?  Not the end of the world if the baby stops crying and you can get stuff done.) \n\nIf the baby likes baby wearing?  Wear that baby while you do stuff!",

        "body": ">or a lot of support\n\nIt's this. Even \"easy\" newborns are very hard when you have 2-4 hands total to get anything done and the owners of those hands have to sleep in shifts. The inability to ever \"tap out\" when you're unsupported puts you basically in fight or flight mode and you don't get a chance to come back down from it because babies aren't made for that. \n\nI honestly think \"difficult\" babies are just NORMAL babies and (at least in the US) new parents (especially those who gave birth) get so little support and are basically asked to the job of a small community or extended family. In turn, new parents are pressured to expect newborns to act like they're not newborns because no one is coming to save us new parents from a truly unfair and unreasonable situation. We spend months fighting to get babies to sleep like older children because we need them to due to the lack of support. An adult can only effectively parent through a very small amount of sleep deprivation and even if you have paid leave you will end up sleep deprived if you're in a nuclear family structure raising a newborn. \n\nWe are pretty financially stable and had been waiting YEARS thinking we might not be able to have a baby, but finally had one and we were very enthusiastic. My baby is on the easier side and both my husband and I got paid leave, but we had no people to help us at all, basically did our entire leave without even a few hours break. We couldn't afford to pay someone to come sit at our house with the baby while we napped or got stuff done. We even have a Snoo to help with the sleep part, but the newborn stage still burned both of us out badly and I'm just grateful my baby sleeps through the night mostly right now at 5 months. I never regretted having a baby but I do feel resentful every single day that all the people who were supposedly going to be there for us have basically done nothing and don't offer to help (even for pay). We have too much money to get subsidized help and too little money to afford paid help.",

She was not happy when we announced that we are expecting our second child, because apparently I’m not fit to be a mum when I struggled so much when my first was a baby. Easy for her to say who has six kids who all slept and ate well when they were babies. I did not sleep for the first nine months of my baby’s life and I spent more than 12 hours every single day with my baby on my boob for the first few months. \n\nAlso, I had my baby in December and it was WAY too cold to take her anywhere for the entire winter. I couldn’t take her for walks in the pram or do anything that required going outside until March, so I was effectively isolated in our house for months on end. My SIL doesn’t have a single winter baby. She refuses to try to understand how hard this was for me too, and has just decided that I’m a bad mum for not coping well when I was dealt an extremely difficult hand. \n\nI was however very fortunate that my baby didn’t cry much. If she had, I would probably have ended up in the psychiatric hospital mere weeks into parenthood. \n\nI definitely agree with you, in other words, about not taking any advice from parents who think the newborn stage is easy.",

        "body": "Just as a reply to your title. These are are things that you discover after you're already a parent. It may reduce your chances of having a repeat but It doesn't affect the chances of having the first.\n\nAs for the luck of the draw, That's something that people don't really talk about, a society that likes promote Parenthood doesn't promote the idea that you could get a difficult child and doesn't really support you when you do get one.\n\nMy first child was an excellent sleeper absolute perfect baby until about 10 years old. She's 15 now and predominantly nonverbal and  has the capacity of about a 8-year-old. My second was a horrible sleeper. She's six now and highly verbal, early self-taught reader, and highly advanced.  \n\nThere is no way to predict the kind of baby that you will have and unfortunately society's tendency to stay on the lighter side of things doesn't really prepare you for when you inevitably run into problems. \n\n\nI know you didn't really come for tips on sleeping babies but my breakthrough with my difficult sleeper was a wagon with a cover. I put a thin crib mattress in it.  I used clothes pins to pin thin swaddling blankets all around the cover to create a nice airy Surrey type carriage That screened out the sunlight for her.  I would take her for a walk around the block She would fall asleep in the wagon and I would leave it in the backyard outside in the shade.  The moment you brought her inside she would wake right up but somehow being outside helped. We are in so-cal But I was able to do this most of the year round. This will be a challenge if you don't have your own safe outdoor space or if it's insanely inclement weather where you are.",

Unless the universe is smiling on you and gives you a baby with an easy going temperament, the first few months are hell on earth. You don’t sleep, you barely eat, showering feels like you need an event planner just to pull it off. It’s awful. And yes, your partner can step up to help, but that baby often just wants mom. My third baby would SCREAM for the entire time I was in the shower for the first 3 months of his life, even if my husband was holding and voicing and doing all the things to try to make him happy. Like wtf. \n\nI’ve had a super hard firstborn, a really easy second born, and a really tricky third born. The second postpartum was my favorite, I have such happy snuggly memories. I’m still trying to block out the memory of my most recent postpartum so I can find the will to live 🫠 there will definitely be no more babies for us because I cannot imagine another postpartum. I think even an easy baby would still be terrible because it’s such a slog. \n\nI know it’s no consolation, but it really does get better. I really felt like I was always angry at my newborn and now at 7 months, he’s such a joy. I can’t get enough of him. But also, solidarity because the newborn stage is just the pits.",

She was overtired, picking fights just to stay awake. My cat was pawing at the door so I was like “sure come on in, join the party.” Cat hopped up on the bed and laid next to my daughter (which is odd in itself because she usually avoids daughter when she’s being wild). WITHIN 5 MINUTES THEY WERE BOTH OUT COLD.  My cat came to my rescue cuz I was at my wit’s end lol. We don’t deserve cats.",

They had an unbreakable bond for 8 years to the point when my sister and niece moved to the next city over, I eventually sent my cat to live with them because you could tell he was so depressed without my niece. \n\nWatching the child-animal-bond is something so amazing. :)",

With under 2 yo kids, I generally keep them away from each other at a safe distance. 2-3 years old is an interesting milestone though because they start to become a lot more aware and interactive, including with the cats. Our cats are surprisingly smart and patient - they don't feel threatened by the kids, and if they are bothered by the kids they tend to just run away, not lash out. With my 3.5 year old since we can talk to him, we talk a lot about caring for our pets and setting boundaries. We have a cat book tailored for kids that educates about cat body language. We have a book about taking care of our cats. We are always showing how to be gentle with them, and when to give them space.",

If my kid got invited to a party over winter break unless you're offering to pick them up and drop them off it's a no from me the last thing I need is one more thing to do. \n\nThat's gotta be disappointing for your son. I'd maybe explain that part, that so many people are too busy during that time.

One key is to put yourself in the shoes of the people you're inviting. People want to know what to expect when they show up to an event. The more uncertainty they have, the more likely they are to sit out. Most people who aren't a best friend type wouldn't be comfortable showing up to realize that only a few people were there, and none of the ones they know best.  \n  \nIn my observation, it's really important to get firm commitments from a small core of people first. Then you can extend more casual invitations to others with a list of people who they can count on being there. That lets the event snowball a bit, one person decides to go because they like the idea and know they won't be the only one there, then another person on the fence shows up because that person was going. You really need to follow up a lot and pressure people a bit to commit or most things just won't get off the ground.  \n  \nI've seen things like this happen a few times, mostly with young people. It's a tough lesson, but it's a good one to learn. The good thing is, once you've had one successful party like that, people will talk about it and organizing another one will be a lot easier. They have a more clear picture in their minds now of what they'll be walking into.",

From my own experience many families are on skiing trips where I live or with their own family/relatives during last ~2 weeks of December. So, we got birthday parties for our daughter and her friends every year the last week or so in November so that she can have a birthday party of her own with friends actually getting the chance of accepting it. Then we celebrate her on December 23 as well but then with our closest relatives and family.",

He invited. He showed up as himself in full 80s glory. That takes confidence most adults don’t have. The disappointment hurts because he aimed high. \n\nTreat the night as a thing that happened, not something that defines him. Don't hover,  no heavy speeches. You might say something simple like, “I know that wasn’t what you hoped for. I’m really proud of the effort you put into it.”  Kids often need space to metabolize feelings before they want comfort.\n\nYou could also validate the reality... “Sometimes people flake. It sucks. It doesn’t mean anything about your worth.” \n\nOne subtle move is to honor what did work. He had one real friend who showed up. \n\nLater you can help him reinterpret the story. Not as “nobody came,” but as “I tried something bold, learned who I can count on, and survived being disappointed.” \n\nNot sure why people are so concerned with booze. Some countries allow booze at 18. Americans think they are the only people that exist.",

He SWEARS he bottle fed our baby with his mom in the room when she was just a few weeks old. I told him she was 2.5 months when she took a bottle for the first time and I was in the room, not his mom—who was in a different state. No logic can get him to say it was a hallucination because it was so real to him. His mom only stayed for the first like week or 2. I didn’t even start pumping until 2 months pp, do I asked him what in the fuck did his mom give him to feed her, because it could not have been my breast milk and there isn’t any formula in the house. He accepts this, but swears it happened anyways.",

        "body": "I asked my granny how she raised four kids because I struggle with just two of them. She said she thinks I put more into it than she did. So I’m guessing they didn’t worry themselves over a lot of the details millennials do. Knowing that I’m making life harder on myself than past generations did doesn’t change my behavior, but I do feel more capable and calm and less wrecked when I remind myself that I am choosing to be a highly involved and engaged parent, it’s not a requirement, and I am giving them everything I’ve got of my own free will.\n\nThey also blamed everything on colick rather than trying to figure out what was going on, let babies cry, had more access to community and “help” via cheap labor, and started whipping them into submission about as soon as they could walk.\n\nEditing to add: I forgot about this until I read a different comment, but my oldest is a really poor sleeper and was suuuuuch a hard baby. I can’t tell you how many boomers told me to put whiskey in her bottle. When I told them *absolutely not* and she wouldn’t take a bottle anyway, the usual response was to ask if I could put some on my nipples? And my mom basically admitted to drugging me with Benadryl so that I would sleep. “Well you DID have allergies sometimes…” Wild. Just wild.",

Certainly some did but I don't think it was a majority and was very location and community specific. What was universal was belly sleeping, which not only does help babies sleep better and long but was promoted by doctors as being safer until the mid 90s when the new research caused recommendations to change and the back-to-sleep campaign started with the (successful) goal of reducing SIDS.\n\nOnce I was at my parents house when my daughter was a year old and saw a picture of me in my crib at around 6 months. I was on my belly turning my face around to look towards the camera, with my head on a pillow, a blanket over me, soft crib bumpers around the crib, and the crib was filled with stuffed animals. I picked up the photo and said to my dad \"look at this death trap you put me in! It's a wonder I survived! I could go to jail for putting my kid in a bed like this!\" and my dad said \"gosh it's so much harder for parents nowadays\" and it's true.",

The older two have never even heard of the tech-driven (and often algorithm/AI-driven) curricula that the elementary schools now rely heavily on. My 6th grader’s school uses SchoolAI for science and the other day it spit out instructions so incomprehensible and/or impossible that the teacher eventually just intervened in frustration and took over the lesson from there - but in general the teachers are locked into using the curriculum the school had purchased. It’s really upsetting and appalling and it’s A LOT different than even when my HS junior was in elementary school.",

I don’t understand why the state would require math and science to be online/ app based at grade 3?!!!! Why can’t human teachers teach them? I distinctly remember all elementary and middle school math books were written in a way that kids could read and, learn, and practice. Why does it have to game/ app based? Honestly I’m also trying to understand why I’m triggered by this but it just feels wrong to me to teach a third grader this way. I feel education requires a great degree of human interaction when children are so young.",

They have an hour of recess minimum, free breakfast and lunch with some food grown hydroponically at school, and the kindergarten classes have no desks. It’s play based so there are a lot of flexible seating choices. They also go on like 5 field trips and seeing them trying to cross country ski and ice skate is hysterical. We don’t let them eat outside because a ton of my students have extreme bee sting allergies and spilling anything sweet makes bees appear everywhere.\n\nThey have a smart board in kindergarten and not a chalk board, I guess that’s technically screen time? but that is because we had students with visual impairments. It was easier to make anything large and high contrast on a smart board than the chalk board. \n\nYou can drive an hour down the road and find a kindergartner exactly as you described. \n\nThe U.S. isn’t uniform in their education system and it’s decided at the local level. My school has a community that demands “kids be kids!” and heavily pushed for more outdoor field trips social emotional learning etc. obviously out test scores aren’t number one but it’s also not last so the community doesn’t care.\n\nHalf my kindergarteners come from a “Nordic inspired” outdoor daycare where they’re outside literally all day unless it’s a safety issue. I didn’t send my child to that daycare as they had strict rules on equipment (3 waterproof snowsuits!!) and it cost a fortune. We used a cheap home daycare and spent the summer in Denmark with the money I saved.\n\nThe private schools near me are extreme. One is just anti vaccine parents because my state requires vaccinations to attend public schools, one is incredibly academic focused and demands extremely high test results from all students. There is also a boarding school that seems focused on training kids who have parents that think their child is Winter Olympics material… \n\nMy school is old, has tons of windows. Right now it has no natural light because it’s s\nextremely cold we have these thick window covers so we don’t lose a ton of heat. The kindergartners learned about radial symmetry and made Waldorf stars! When it’s sunny they’re so beautiful. \n\nAsk the other parents of kids at your child’s forest school where they send their kid to school. You can sometimes pay tuition to go to some public schools if you don’t live in district and they allow it. We allow it and have maybe 12 who pay tuition.",

This doesn’t seem to be a local issue. I’ve yet to hear of a school district that doesn’t use e screens as the primary teaching tool. The results have been disastrous. Literacy rates completely in the trash nation wide. Math and science scores are abysmal. No music class. No art. 30 minutes of playground that looks akin to a prison yard. Long hours, developmentally inappropriate expectations. We decided to send our daughter to an AMS certified montessori program (we’re lucky we have one, most places don’t) for preschool , kindergarten, and elementary. The hours are much shorter, kids walk around freely. They work with their hands. They get 45 minutes for outdoor time in almost all weather. And, most importantly to me, no screens whatsoever. My daughter is almost 4 and can read and do small math problems already because of this teaching method. What we’ll do for middle school is most likely homeschooling with a private teacher.",

Full of joy, play based for the littles and project based for the bigs, and with a really tight knit, involved, and caring community. \n\nWhat people don’t often talk about is that many private schools offer financial aid. So if you are not feeling great about your public options and there are privates you do feel great about but are worried about affordability, it’s worth still applying and finding out what happens before fully writing them off.",

Kindergarten is usually a full day now though. It was half day for a long time. Start time varies. Where I have lived for my kids,  Elementary grades started later that HS between 8:30 and 9:30.

Turned out it was a little pillow that says \" I love you\" that she hang and wanted us surprise me .  I immediately went on my knees and hug her and let her know that I love her too.   \n\nKids are amazing. Apologies and when things like that happens keep in mind that they will grow very soon and all thatll be left will be memories.

I’m not sure if I left that exact page open or if he turned to it but I left the book untended to do I can’t even remember what, and when I came back, he was scribbling over a doodle of him and I. It wasn’t some intricate masterpiece. Just a cute doodle little I loved. I gasped and either said “oh no what are you doing?” Or something alone those lines. Immediately his little heart broke, and he began crying saying “oh man, wipe it?????? Mama doesn’t like it? Oh man” He was so distraught. I held him and tried to tell him was okay. He cried himself to sleep in my arms. He’s almost three now and I will never forget it. I will always feel horrible.  In hindsight it’s his own book and it didn’t really matter. It will always kill me breaking his spirit that day. I thought he’d never want to draw again (he still loves to).",

You’d want her to apologize and take responsibility, right?

Next milestone I’m looking forward to is when they can all swim independently and we don’t have to get in the pool with them.\n\nEdit to add: turn the tv off. Don’t put it on as background noise. It will interrupt your child’s ability to immerse themselves in their play and learn how to play independently… boredom is great for independent play & imagination.\n\nIf your child can’t play independently, set up an activity, pour yourself a tea, grab a book for yourself and make it clear that you need so rest time too.",

I don’t feel any external pressure to do this BUT I’m trying to raise my family different than how I was raised. \n\nI’m 40 and one of 5 kids in the home and I can’t recall a single time that my mum ever played with us, so a craft with us, played with us at the park, built sandcastles with us at the beach, went for walks with us… nothing. Dinners were eaten off of our laps staring at the TV. There’re was no family bonding. \n\nMy siblings and I did our own thing with our own friends and were expected home by dark. None of us are close and I can’t remember the last time I spoke to one of my brothers outside of the yearly birthday and Christmas texts. \nMy mum is disinterested in her grandchild and as a result I barely speak to her. I honestly don’t understand why she even had 5 kids. \n\nThat’s simply not the family dynamic I wanted. I chose to only have 1 child and I knew that that would also mean I’m her playmate a lot of the time. She’s 9 and pretty good about crafting and making things on her own now, and she plays outside with the neighborhood kids quite a lot but we also do a lot together. Last night we were playing card games before bed. We go on walks together, we play together in the pool. When she was younger it was a lot of imagination games, which I admit I’m not enthralled by, especially when she wants to tell me exactly what to say and do, but I made that commitment by having just her, and it’s not always feasible to have playdates every day (although we do have them often).  She is as way better behaved when she was occupied too. \n\nWe eat dinner at the dining table together, every night with no devices allowed. We talk about our days. She came into my room this morning and chatted with me while I drank my morning tea. \n\nI WANT a relationship with her. Not because it’s expected by anyone else.",

It's also pretty normal that I'm \"entertaining\" them by giving them some craft supplies, baking, going for walks, outings etc. but that's all just normal life stuff and obviously I'm including my kids. Also pretty normal to have a lazy day cause life is busy. \n\nI don't think it's been a crazy huge shift in that department. When I was growing up in the 90's I remember being dragged around with my parents, helping in the garden/kitchen when I was little. Visiting relatives. The big difference is the free-ranging, but that didn't happen till school age. I won't boot my big kids out the door to sunset like when I was growing up so we naturally continue doing more family things instead.",

We play board games, take family walks, go to community events, and do some structured activities during the week.

        "body": "I'm not exactly sure about anyone else here but growing up as a relatively only child (sister a decade older, parents split when I was young and she went to live with dad), I recalled playing by myself a lot using my imagination, whatever toys I had on hand, and the TV. Sometimes the TV was on and I wasn't watching it, it was just background noise while I did my own thing. I also read books a lot, but I read pretty fast so I'd run out faster than my mom could keep up with. \n\nMy daughter more or less is the same. She plays by herself, I could put Sesame Street on and she'd probably watch a little, but then ignore it to keep playing with her toys or me. If she actually sits down and watches, I pretty much know she's nap ready. She doesn't need it on when she's playing by herself, but I think like me, she likes hearing music so I'll sometimes straight up just throw music on for her and let her cook. Honestly, watching Sesame Street is more for my own entertainment than hers at this point 💀\n\nBut I'd say reframe \"entertaining\" as \"engaging\" and \"bonding\" because that's really all you're doing. I'm entertaining my toddler by getting up and \"following the DJ\" as many times as she wants in between rousing rounds of \"mama throws the ball and I go pick it up and bring it back\" for our regular cardio work outs. Everything in balance.",

Interact with your kid! Have your 4 year old help out in the house or do more arts and crafts projects. send them to a friend's house and trade off play dates with another family.

Between laundry, cleaning, cooking my mom would sit down to watch her judge Judy and have a tea party with me. While she did laundry she’d set up baskets and told me they were a boat, if she was in the kitchen I was probably in the dog pen and she was talking to me like I was a puppy. There was usually her shows on or sometimes a movie I enjoyed but we interacted in a adhoc play style all day as a young kid. \n\nI think today a lot of people have a more curated play style, some of that is availability, there’s more options these days. Some of it is pressure from social media. Some of that is personality, some people just go go go and like to be doing things. \n\nPersonally we ebb and flow, some weekends we are booked solid and we look like the people who are constantly entertaining their kid. Others, like this weekend we putter around the house with the Olympics on, having tea parties. We made cookies and painted today and that was our organized activities.

Between daycare and work all week and her swim and gym classes and church on the weekends, plus family time with the grandparents and cousins, we typically just try to find 1-2 “free and easy” activities for us to do as a family.

My daughter started saying she was sad she wasn’t a boy around that age, and we found out it was because “boys play in the NHL and girls don’t.” We started talking about how there are tons of professional female hockey players and started watching the occasional PWHL game in our house. The talk of wanting to be a boy stopped almost immediately.\n\nI think kids tie so much to gender based on what they see, which is a great opportunity for us to show kids that all genders can like and participate in just about all things! Boys can like pink! Girls can be into video games and dragons! Nothing is off limits!",

All of my cousins were boys, I had a brother, and I played with the boys at school. I didn’t like typical girl stuff and preferred things like Pokemon and Dragonball Z. I didn’t really have any girl peer influences that showed being girly in a positive light. I remember downloading *NSYNC music on Napster (that’s a blast from the past!) and my cousins making fun of me. I vividly remember thinking I was born in the wrong body. That it was so much cooler being a boy. \n\nAnd thennn, I hit puberty. I started crushing on boys. I made friends with girls and started realizing how great it was to be a girl. It made a world of difference being around peers who didn’t immediately say “girl” stuff was lame.",

She wanted to be a boy to fit in with the rest of her team. She ended up switching to softball last year and hasn't mentioned wanting to be a boy again. She is still what we used to call a \"tomboy\" but that's fine.

My daughter has always been girly, but loves professional sports (NFL, NBA etc) At one point, she was afraid she wouldn't be able to be involved in sports, not because she has minimal athletic ability (she doesn't, but we never really pushed it as she has always done plenty of \"natural\" exercise) but because she was a girl. So we started pointing out all the women who are on the sidelines doing interviews, attending to injuries etc and she decided that that's how she is going to be involved for her career. She is slated to start a sports management program at college in the fall and is so excited to get in there.\n\nI think society places too much emphasis on gender, although I am sure the intention was good. We've seem to come full circle in a lot of ways by acting like it matters more than it does. \n\nMay your budding hockey player find success and have fun :)",

I have a 6 year old son who has liked \"feminine\" things (pink, purple, dresses, flowers, butterflies, rainbows, long hair, barbie dolls, etc) since he was 3 years old. We have been supportive of this and have not told him that he can't like those things. We've told him he can wear what he likes, play with whatever he wants to play with (kid probably has like 20 barbies), we let him choose how to decorate his bedroom and he chose purple walks and pink floral bedding, etc. and he has never said he wants to be a girl because he IS a girl, but he has expressed frustration at how society expects those interests from girls and aren't as open to boys enjoying those things. The teasing he has gotten has been very minimal, thankfully (one time he wore his pink unicorn rainboots to school and the other kids said those were girl rain boots), but he still sees the messaging around what is \"for girls\" and what is \"for boys\". I have heard countless times how the boys clothes sections of the store are so boring and the girls stuff is so much more fun and colorful and why don't boys get to wear clothes like that? So it may be that your son is just feeling the same way about how society tries to limit boys who enjoy colorful and pretty things. Maybe if you help him express his interests more and help him feel more comfortable doing so then his feelings about that will calm down. My son does tend to keep his feminine stuff (dresses, barbies, etc) at home and presents like a more typical boy at school, but having home be his safe space has definitely helped him feel more comfortable with who he is.",

He outright said \"I want to be a girl\" a couple months ago when he was still 3 and a couple nights ago he asked me if I was born a boy or a girl. I'm almost certain it's stemming from his confusion between what he likes and what people around him are telling him he's allowed to like. It's really sad, I hate that we are still dealing with this small minded bs. \n\nI grew up viewing myself as a Tom boy and even now I don't resonate with many traditional \"girly\" things but that doesn't make me any less of a woman that those who do like those things and I've never been shamed for this. Men on the other hand aren't given this same grace. I've explained to my son that anyone who tells him X or Y is for girls are just sharing their opinion, they may speak as if it's a fact but it's only an opinion and the only opinion that he needs to care about is his own. I've asked him if he likes pink, to which he replied yes and then pointed at how that was proof that boys can in fact like pink. He always seems to take what I say on board and hasn't yet changed his behaviour but his Dad is constantly telling him certain things are for girls and he often returns from Dad's with lots of new questions for me.\n\nUltimately, if he grows up to be trans then I will support whatever he wants to do to feel happy in his body but I hate the idea of him being shamed for his interests and having to muffle his personality to please the small minds of others or worse, feeling confused about his identity now because he is trans but because others have convinced him he can't be a boy if he likes the colour pink only to continue to feel confused because he was never trans to begin with.

I would have a couple of talks with him over the next few months, keep checking in on why he feels that way, what he thinks being a girl is, that sort of thing.

At least get 3 out of the 5 work week days covered. \n\nKids sick, you can prop them on the couch and work. School age kids you can probably get away with no aftercare or vacation daycare. Summer you can schedule some camps but don’t have to worry too much about covering every day of the summer. \n\nI saved a ton of money on daycare because of my wfh and my spouses weird rotating schedule.  But no way could I parent and work.  I paid for 3 days I think I did mon, wed, fri. And on days my husband had to work if it fell on Tues or Wed my mil would help me out.

Maybe you could get away with paying for 3 days of daycare and juggling cheaper babysitters the other 2 days.

My kids were 4 and 2 and at that age, it really was impossible to concentrate on the separate jobs of parenting and my work job. Especially when there were meetings? There's no way to account for emergencies or tantrums or anything that kids are typically known for.\n\nNow my kids are 10 and 8, and while they are typically in school while I'm working, there are times when I have to take a virtual meeting while they're home. Even though it's generally easier than when they were younger, it's still less than ideal. Of course you feel like you're failing at two jobs.\n\nHow old are your kids? Are they home all day? Do you have any other options for them during the day? Depending on their ages, you might consider hiring a mother's helper, a high school or even middle school kid to spend time with your kids on days when you have important meetings. Usually you can pay them less than sitters since you are in the home with them.",

Now-a-days, me and my husband and our kids live out of state from everyone and we can FaceTime, Zoom, text, call, etc. Me and my mom having a running game of Scrabble on the Scrabble app every single day and have for years.

Been over here for like 17 years. Now that I have my own kids I am acutely aware that the moment was much harder for them than it was for me.\n\nVisit as much as possible.  Even with an ocean between us, I’m still very close with my parents even though I only travel home once every couple of years.

My mother has early dementia.\n\nAs I fly back frequently now to deal with elder care disasters, I find myself really wishing that I hadn't moved from coast to coast (US) at 20. By the time that I had my daughter in my 30s, my (locally born) husband and I were firmly rooted homeowners and loath to move. We took our daughter back twice a year, and when they were still able to fly, they came to see us twice a year. But I miss them, and my daughter doesn't know her grandparents the way she would if we had lived closer. And helping with the last few years of their lives is excruciatingly difficult from afar.\n\nI guess I'm just saying, I hope you have the opportunity to live fairly near any grandkids that might crop up in the future, either because your kid moves back, or you move to them. My teenager is pretty much set on going to college back East - well hey, turnabout's fair play. But even though I have always intended to grow old in this house where she's growing up.... I just don't know any more.",

I understand theres some circumstances for a middle schooler to have a phone, but at least get a \"dumbphone\" or a smartwatch that works independently to make calls/texts. We're not super strict personally, tablets for long car rides or places with long wait times (like the ER),  both kids have tvs & Xbox systems (but they arent brain rotting on them 24/7) and they are monitored to make sure the shows and games are age appropriate content. Also, punishment is no technology, so they cant be acting a fool and be rewarded with it. \n\nTiktok & YouTube access to young kids is wild to me, like I'll show my kids a funny video I come across, but they definitely arent allowed to independently look at those apps.\n\nIt definitely seems to be a socioeconomic divide, as well. Our local schools are rural title 1, and its very apparent that the students with more engaged parents and/or raised in a better economic environment have more restrictions & monitoring of tech than students with less engaged parents and/or dealing with poverty. \n(I'm not hating on those financially struggling, were a working class family also.

We don't go often, sometimes we plan to go and need to leave because he's having a tough day/is on the edge of over stimulated or whatever. Sometimes we go and have to trade off who is entertaining him or walking around outside with him. But not giving the digital coping tool means we are able to teach him other coping skills for boredom or not being the center of attention or needing to wait etc. there have been periods of time in his life where Restaurants or cafes or even just most going out other than to parks was just not possible.

My kids love their Nex and yoto's, video games, and Lingo kids on an iPad. But their days are spent mostly playing with each other and being creative. \n\nMy personal take is that restricting things or putting hard limits on things actually creates boundaries for kids to try to push back on. I also don't think it teaches kids the skills needed to be able to find balance in life. Technology is a reality in our world, so I think it's more appropriate to teach kids how to manage that and be self aware. \n\nThe self awareness is key, it builds intrinsic motivation. One day I was home alone with the kids and I had something extremely important that had to be done, so the kids ended up watching TV for a couple of hours. Later in the day, while playing in the snow, my eldest was absolutely distraught that she had \"wasted so much time\" watching TV because now she didn't have enough time in the snow. We talked about it and how the next day we could think of the things she wants to do and set an alarm for each. I didn't have to lecture, my kid learned it for herself and now she thinks about her time more. \n\nFunny side note- My youngest was just yelling at my oldest that she \"doesn't do anything but the iPad!\" because she wants to play \"super kitties\". Eldest had only been on for 15 minutes, learning to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star lol.",

I like that the content is curated and filtered, that we can see what he’s doing, and that we can set time limits. Would he have been deprived if we’d just stuck to paper books and made him ask us his questions? Probably not. I’m not exactly regretful, but kids with access with a screen will prioritize it over other choices (at least until their time limits are up), and sometimes I think it impacts his mood.\nTLDR: Bought my kid a tablet; your kid doesn’t need one.",

His creativity is growing. \n\nAll in all, it has been great without screens for him. I'm trying to model a childhood more like my own was than allow him to have non-stop screens from every angle. When we do have screen time, I'm introducing media I grew up with. Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, Star Wars, Garfield, things I know are safe. He gets these as a treat or on sick days. \n\nToday was so cold and windy that we didn't get to be outside much, so we sat and worked on some diamond painting projects together. He has a pack of stickers of characters like Pikachu and Groot and whatnot and I have a seasonal decoration I'm working on. We played vinyl records and took turns picking albums and took turns flipping the albums. No advertisements every other song, no \"skip\" button to pay attention to, no screens to distract our eyes. Just good old fashioned music and crafting. Not unlike my childhood in grandma's sewing room with her classical music station on the radio collaborating on a quilt or making bridesmaids dresses for someone's upcoming wedding. Keeping our hands busy with good music in the background and nothing else. So simple. So satisfying. Such an amazing day.",

        "body": "I had a similar but not situation when I was younger. In 5th grade, I had a teacher that made us to push ups or hold heavy books as punishment. I told my mom, she freaked, and called the school. My teacher the next day announced “Since we can’t do pushups anymore because of (my name).” It made me feel called out but in my situation the other kids didn’t want to do the “punishments”. This teacher then went on to constantly give me the vibe that she does not like me. At some point she told me I could only ask 3 questions a day for the rest of the year. No one else got that rule except for me. \n\nOverall, I think that it should’ve been asked if you wanted to remain anonymous. I understand your daughter feeling called out, and now it’s like the teacher isn’t acting the same bc of your daughter/you, and then has the audacity to bring up the subject of censorship. This wasn’t treated professionally by any means and you nor your daughter deserve that. \n\nI’m also not surprised by the teacher acting inappropriately because we knew she didn’t know proper boundaries when she had kids write bible verses on the wall in a public school.",

She raised a valid concern through you and now shes being asked to either give permission for her story to be used as a censorship example or refuse and feel like shes censoring more. Thats way too much weight for a middle schooler to carry.\n\nThe principal shouldnt have named you at all. The whole point of you reaching out was to give feedback without putting your kid in the spotlight. And the teacher asking permission to use this as a lesson on censorship shows she completely missed the point about separation of church and state in public schools.\n\nYour daughter needs to know this isnt on her. You were doing your job as a parent. The adults in the building fumbled the response. She didnt censor anyone. She went to school to learn not to navigate adult sized conflicts about religion and boundaries.\n\nI dont have a magic fix but your instinct to protect her from further conversations with the teacher about YOUR concerns is exactly right. The principal needs to make that clear to the teacher. Your kid shouldnt be the middleman in this mess. Hang in there.",

And we all know how important this kind of thing is to kids. \n\nAt this point I would kick it over the principals head and email the school board. Make sure you Leave a paper trail. \n\nThat teacher needs repercussions and that includes not being your daughter’s teacher anymore. \n\nBut you also need to realize, mom, that now your daughter is a target and you may want to look into a different school situation because if the teacher gets fired it will be labeled your daughters fault. \n\nI personally homeschool and a lot of people homeschool due to situations like this. Teacher bullying is a big problem that isn’t talked about (and ftr I have nothing but respect for most teachers. However there’s always one bad one in the bunch). \n\nI am also anti censorship but free speech isn’t guaranteed everywhere and it isn’t appropriate everywhere. For example if you went into this woman’s church and started talking about satanism I doubt they would take that lightly or say that your speech was protected. (Just a tool you can use there if it comes down to it)\n\nGood luck. With this crazy nation right now you’re going to need it.",

Forget the fancy breakfast. Forget the limited screens. Give yourself a break wherever you can. Make a deal with your husband to give each other an hour off.\n\nAnd if you have *any* friends or family nearby and a safe means of travel, don't be afraid to ask for a bit of help.\n\nI remember what it felt like during the COVID lockdown. I trip to the grocery store, with the chaos of a black Friday sale, was considered a \"break\" and a \"relief\" for my husband and I to take turns with. I hope you two can find some form of \"breaks\" during the storm. \n\nHow about a video call with grandparents or cousins while you're in the next room?",

Figured, might as well lock down on the beach instead of in ice-cold Minnesota.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, my kid lost a tooth and I'm realizing I never packed any dollar coins.   So here I am,  10pm on a weeknight, driving all over the island to find any open establishment that just might have a few dollar coins on hand.  Bars, restaurants, laundromats, gas stations, anywhere.\n\nAfter hours and hours of driving around and dozens of establishments visited, I found a convenience store that had a few in their register.",

I shudder in memory. But it worked. ",

We have a great Aquarium and a Great Wolf Lodge within an hour driving distance here, but I said yes anyway, brought my Mom and Dad, and made it a vacation for the four us. \n\nNow it's a tradition for my son and I, pretty much every year we take some kind of a birthday trip.  His request for this year is Paris, which may be doable because I have a nephew living in Paris and my son is actually a cheap traveler.\n\nFunny thing is the Arizona thing came because of this family he watched on YouTube that you know got paid to go there and promote it and everything which I hate but .... it triggered this intense desire in my son to travel and go to new places, so I can't really complain about that.  My husband hates travel, but I love it, so it's beyond wonderful to have that and all the memories with my son.\n\n(Editing to add, just so my son does not come off entitled/spoiled, he is 100% okay with it if we don't do Paris this year and has other more budget friendly options in mind too.  He's just taking French and learning about France at school and is really enthusiastic about Paris.)",

(Or just about.)\n\nLong story short, I bought my daughter a nice little Bento box, specifically [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000246GSE), when she went into kindergarten. I didn't want my daughter to be stuck with crap food -- soggy bologna on Wonder bread, a bag of chips, and a box of room temperature chocolate milk -- so I would prep the night before, spend about 10-15 minutes in the morning making her lunch, and send her to school every day with a hot, fresh, healthy lunch. She would get things like rotisserie chicken with steamed broccoli and butter noodles, broiled salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes, pot roast with roasted potatoes and sweet corn, 1/3 lb cheeseburger with lettuce, pickles, and ketchup on a bakery roll, pan-fried pierogis with kielbasa and roasted broccoli, and whatever else I could come up with that I thought she'd enjoy. These would always be paired with some fresh fruit (usually apple slices, berries, peach slices, or pineapple chunks) and a small dessert (mini cupcakes, brownie bites, cookies, etc).\n\nI never thought this was a big deal. I'm her father, she's my daughter, and I have an obligation to make sure she eats well, especially in her childhood. I didn't think anything was particularly over the top. It *literally* took about 15-20 minutes (including prep time) to make her a healthy and tasty lunch. My daughter enjoyed it and often remarked that her lunches were looked upon with envy by her friends in the cafeteria. \"What is Daughter having for lunch today\" became a thing with her social group. Over the years (mostly in elementary school days) I even had several parents come up to me and ask me to stop giving my daughter \"such extravagant lunches\" because apparently their kids were coming home and complaining that my daughter has really good lunches and they don't and they saw it as unfair. (I did not change my habits.)\n\nI honestly do not believe I was going over the top with this. I *do* admit that my choices were atypical but I see that as a shortcoming of others, not an extravagance of mine. Yeah, I could have spent 5-10 minutes on dry sandwiches and prepackaged \"fruit in liquid\" and stuff like that, but for an extra five minutes I can give my daughter something substantially better -- and I will never understand why people think that's \"over the top\".",

Let him experience the consequences of his decision so he can learn why something is the way it is. He's going to tell you he's cold and ask for the coat before he is frost bitten. Yes, it would be inconvenient but better than battling with him. \n\nAlso, what do you do with respect to gentle parenting\n\n\nEdit: my god there are a lot of obtuse people on the internet today. No one, myself included, is talking about letting your child become hypothermic or frostbitten. Even in conditions as low as -25c, your child is not becoming frost bitten or hypothermic in 5 minutes without a jacket. Letting them experience a few moments of discomfort is not going to hurt them. If they still don't choose to wear a jacket, it would make sense to step in. If your child is not capable of expressing discomfort, obviously do something different.",

I know it'll be a separate tantrum once he realizes he's freezing, but maybe it'll at least nip the \"no coat\" behaviour in the bud for future.\n\nRe: gentle parenting, we try to always acknowledge his feelings - not his behaviour - first. Unless he is doing harm, of course, which is when we usually add a consequence (e.g. throwing the Lego = Lego goes away). The trouble is that however we react, his reaction escalates. The best tactic I find works with him is to simply walk away and ignore it all. However, that feels cruel, so I usually try to give him space but stay near enough that he knows I'm there.",

You don't have to eat it, but ice cream isn't a choice today.\" You can choose the food, they can choose to eat or not. \n\nIf they wanted to go out without a coat...let them. Just spend about 30 seconds at the front door fumbling with your keys before getting started and most kids will be ready to get their jacket. Or get logical. \"Well, I don't have time to go to the doctor today. And if you get frostbite, you'll definitely need to see the doctor. ... You won't get to play outside b/c even if I was okay with you not wearing your coat, the school rules are different. ...\" And see if they will comply based on some kind of logic...even if it's not a straight path. \n\nGive him a time limit for getting dressed. Or make him get dressed outside of his room (bathroom, your bedroom?) so that he will be less distracted/less likely to try and lay down or do whatever he's doing. \n\nTaking things away at this age isn't particularly helpful - they can't connect the behavior if it's not immediate. \n\nFor me, when my kids were this age I would ignore rude or mean behavior/comments to the point where if they were like, \"DID YOU HEAR ME? I SAID I HATE YOU!\" I would look around and go, \"What is that odd noise I'm hearing? So strange...oh well, I guess if someone is talking to me nicely, I'll hear it b/c my ears can't understand [mean words/rude comments/whining/whatever]!\" Then go back to being occupied by anything other than what the fuck is going on with my kid. \n\nAlso - maybe he needs more than a \"gentle\" nudge and needs to be guided through the process. At that age, if it was my kid I'd be like, \"Oh, just like when you were a baby and I would get you dressed!\" And sometimes that can be motivating as well.",

Go for it. Legos instead of a bath? Cool. Stay up late? Sure. \n\nLoosening the reins sounds counter intuitive, but it made us realize just how controlling we had become.

Transitions are easy now. We are working on appropriate behaviours when angry using a tantrum game. It really let me understand where my language was not helping in hard moments and focusing on basically training and practice the positive behaviours you want to see. You isolate the positive behaviour you’d like to see from the negative one, like getting dressed and you use a variety of different methods to teach and positively enforce it over a couple of weeks. \n\nI’d really recommend. Its straightforward advice that I’d say works well for most people and doesn’t require you to delve into the far reaches of your mental health to implement. What’s nice is even though it’s not fixing things overnight in any way it’s easy to see positive effects quite fast and allows you to celebrate wins together with your kid if your in a cycle of negativity \n\nIt’s on YouTube for free and it’s also a paid course.",

Even my 7 year old can’t. They just don’t have the developmental capacity to do it, so the anger might be from feeling like he’s failing you but doesn’t have the skills to fix it. We have to guide our child through every step still and that is normal (unfortunately) for most (not all) children at this age. Hope this helps a little!",

        "body": "My 6 year old is getting counseling because he's going through a lot. A line really stuck with us in one of our books recently \"Kids do well when they can.\" No kid wants to be a bad kid. If they're struggling then there's reasons behind it. \n\nYou mention a lot of things I've ran into with mine, mine's having problems. It started when he started public school.   \n  \nWe've recently gotten him evaluated and we're waiting for the results. In general though mine seems to get overwhelmed, and when the trigger point is hit, he becomes explosive. Check out the book the explosive child, but also maybe talk with his school counselor if they have one. Talk with the teacher. See what they're observing. What we figured out is he's putting like all of his mental energy into behaving at school, when really he's having a hard time because he has a hard time focusing, and he gets corrected often (talking, sitting still, distracting classmates). \"I get told to be quiet 100 times a day\" is something he says regularly. And he isn't/wasn't exploding at school, but by the time he gets home he's now in his safe space, and his parents (me and my wife) go to correct him and he's done being corrected. So he needs more support from us at home. Less correction. Less punishment. \n\nWe've had to start letting things go. Sometimes he gets dressed all by himself no problem. Other times if I walk in his room and he's not dressed, nudging him along is only going to make it worse. I just start getting him dressed without saying anything. If he doesn't want his coat. I just carry a coat with me until he realizes it's cold and changes his mind. \n\nKids do well when they can.",

Sometimes I feel so sad because I want my sweet little guy back BUT the reality is it’s just his way of testing boundaries and growing. He’s still my little buddy and I’m glad he feels like he can lose his shit with me. \n\nHere’s what I have found to work well in reducing the big feelings and disrespect in my home.\n- We have firm boundaries in place and if he wants to wail and whine he can do it in his bedroom. If he won’t go there I will physically put him in there. I don’t know how many times I’ve said ‘it’s okay to be upset and frustrated, it is NOT ok to hurt someone.’ I am VERY firm if I need to be. Respectful and kind but firm. There are consequences like losing pizza movie night or weekend cartoons. \n\n- We have a list of family expectations (printed on our fridge) like ‘be kind and respectful, take your dishes to the sink after you eat etc.’ and we also have a list of chores. Each kid has to take part in chores every morning and when they do they each get a pom pom in the family jar. I’ve noticed that he THRIVES having expectations and a role to play in our home. It seems to give him a sense of autonomy. \nHe also LOVES being praised and so I praise constantly for the good stuff. It seems to lessen the tantrums. \n\n- We have also talked lots about noticing the feelings in his body when he is getting worked up and he has a checklist of his triggers to run through (do you need a drink, do you need fresh air, do you need the bathroom, do you need a snack, do you need a hug). I kid you not we have been doing this for years and he still doesn’t get it except once in a blue moon but we keep doing it anyway in the hopes that one day he will be able to recognize his triggers. \n\n- I snuggle him constantly. Especially after he’s had these hard moments. And we talk it all through. He doesn’t want to feel that way. \n\nNot sure if any of this is helpful or applicable and we certainly don’t get it right all the time. I have yelled on multiple occasions (and then repaired and apologized after). We aren’t perfect and I don’t expect him to be either but we thrive for kindness, love and respect and I think if we show him those things through loving boundaries and consequences then it will all come good. Sending you a hug. I know it’s so hard.\n\nAlso edit to add - it is just a phase. I have a 7 year old and went through this before and it was BRUTAL. But we got through it! I remember going to bed each night just praying we would waken up in a different phase and having moved on from that cycle and eventually we did.",

Well this is the consequence of not cleaning out your bag daily, isn’t it. The same with packing their bag in the morning. You forget your drink bottle or hat? You go without for the day and don’t get to play with your friends in the sun (they have water bubblers the kids can use).

I told my 8 year old that the American government has made a big squad of fake police that are kidnapping people and locking them in a place like jail but with worse conditions. How they are taking innocent people who are following the rules of immigration like us (we're Americans who emigrated to Germany in 2020 and are working on our citizenship.) First the fake police kidnapped people because of the color of their skin, and now they kidnap for trying to stop these bad fake police from kidnapping their neighbors and hurting people, or even just videotaping them or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I explained how they killed a woman (a mom with 3 kids, and their ages) because her wife was teasing a fake police officer and he was angry. I explained how the government then lied about it. I'll have to explain this murder to her today too. I was too upset to formulate an accurate but age appropriate truthful explanation yesterday. \n\nThey can understand more than you might think and deserve to know what is happening. You know your children and will find the real ght words. You're a good mom for asking for help and searching for resources to do this in the best way for your kids.",

She made a comment about the movie like \"I didnt like that Sunny interrupted the festival\" and I used it to teach her about Portland and why we absolutely SHOULD like that Sunny interrupted the festival. For a four year old she was quite receptive ad I credit that to her being primed by the movie itself.\n\n\nContext for anyone who hasnt seen it: the plot is basically this one pony Sunny peacefully protests at a festival to declare that the rest of the Earth Pony population needs to get over themselves and stop hating on unicorns just because they're different. ",

Thrn I told him that Cap startrd his career as a superhero some eighty years ago, fighting against a bunch of guys that are as mean as Gobby (the toddler version of Green Goblin).\n\nI told him those meanie guys were called nazis and fascists. They wanted back then (and still want nowadays) everybody to be miserable all the time, just like Gobby commits acts of evil for evil's sake.\n\nAfter all, ICE and their supporters are not much different from cartoonish villains in a sense. Some people are just plain evil. Adult fans of Marvel may know of another villain which may be inappropriate for younger audiences, but which Stan Lee and Jack Kirby modeled after people like Trump: the Hate-Monger. The stories including this villain are great for teenagers though, specially with all that is going on in the world right now. Hate-Monger used the MAGA playbook decades before MAGA was even a thing.",

If you show them how to get well informed and educated, it doesn’t matter how much garbage they consume on social media, they will have the mechanisms to discern what’s correct. \n\nSadly, the US has fallen to a lack of education and a level of materialism that I don’t think can be fixed with the next elections. The country elected a government whose ignorance is destabilizing the entire world. \n\nSo, all I can ask, from a neighbour country, is please educate kids to be a positive in our world, over just having things. There’s tons of amazing things kids can do to learn and help their communities. Maybe focus on that, it will make you and them feel better. ❤️‍🩹",

Ever watch older shows and the parents get all crazy about the school board. \n\nThose stay at home moms in the 60s were running all that stuff suppling snacks, feeding the team one time a week, it was a status symbol, we are well enough off that I have time for this.\n\nNow days, people want others to help out, everyone help out so it doesn’t fall on one person everytime.\n\nI tended to always get put on food and treats in preschool for parties. Because I’m a good cook I guess and make fun stuff. But I also am a single mom and work 60 hours a week. Sometimes it works out fine and me and the littles had time to make peep race cars and Santa kabobs but sometimes I didn’t. I couldn’t say no because I did that for one Christmas party and they just had no treats or snack at their Christmas party. \n\nThe problem is too is being inclusive, which I think is getting out of control in some aspects but I mean some kids can’t afford a snack or have parents that don’t care enough. So making everyone takes turns ensures everyone gets a snack each time.\n\nI used to do other kids homework for food everyday. It was terrible and I’d beg the other kids. My parents were nice enough but my mom had mental problems and would often not give me money or say the school is stealing from her or that I was stealing from her or that she already gave it too me. I was just hungry I wasn’t spending it on candy I was buying kids sandwich’s and the stuff they didn’t want because I was that hungry. I tried making my own lunch’s but since we didn’t have food in the house often it would be like one sandwich on questionable bread and some crackers or something.",

I’m not necessarily talking about sending in regular snacks or being a present parent. It’s more the emails like, “Theater Parents! Sign ups are now posted for tech week! Monday is Italian Night, Tuesday is Taco Night!” and so on throughout the week) and everyone is busy and the easy dessert spots get snapped up within five minutes and suddenly you’re trying to figure out how to fit making lasagna for 50 teens on a Thursday night into your schedule and it is like this for EVERY ACTIVITY your kids are involved with. And of course you can opt out but why do we have all these expectations to begin with? Why can’t the kids have one meal night and just pack sandwiches the rest of the week?

They are doing it to seek validation for themselves. What’s even worse is that many are stressing themselves out doing it. The added stress leads them to yell at their kids, yell at their spouses, and prevents them from being good parents. The customized snack boxes, the dinners with elaborate decorations, and the big sis/lil sis gifts for every activity (don’t get me started on big sis/lil sis nonsense) have become more important than the kids themselves.

I had a very involved class and I remember the freshman on the team all got together with our moms one or two evenings and crafted and planned out our days. It was so fun and I think about it all the time. Even the dads got involved! It wasn’t a huge money expenditure but it took some effort but it was just fun team building. \n\nBut I also remember team pasta dinners and book fairs and other activities.",

But there are the moms who seem to love assembling 20some cute little gift style bags with a full size Prime energy drink, granola bar etc etc with extras for the siblings(!!!) I’m not one of those moms. I go big decorating for birthdays, last/first day of school, etc. But I get angry at the idea of dropping $150+ on sport snacks when I can buy exactly what my kid likes. Same goes for our scouts. Why can’t I just send my kid with a snack instead of signing up to bring the whole group a snack and remeber that X is gluten free, and Y cant have whatever. Growing up parents took turns cutting up orange slices that we ate out of a huge Tupperware bowl and Gatorade mixed in one of those 5 gallon beverage cooler with a little paper cup. But instead let’s give every kid a plastic water bottle and a plastic Gatorade bottle and 5 individually wrapped snacks. 🙄",

Balloons, steamers, pics of the kids, you name it.

I think the difference between then and now, besides it being an obligation, is that more kids are allergic to more things and they realize not everyone is cleanly so besides telling you exactly what snacks to bring they also have to be store bought and clearly packaged as such which is of course more expensive than making something at home. As far as scholastic book fairs there was always a set up to buy in person which was my favorite part. Getting to leave class to shop at the book fairs in the library are some of my best memories. It was a better experience and created a sense of community within the school rather than just filling out the paper and sending it in. Also, some people didn’t always have the cash before the deadline or only had a few dollars to spare so going in person and being able to buy a scented gel pen for $0.50 and other trinkets vs an $8 book was ideal for a lot of kids so they didn’t feel left out. Why do we do this to ourselves today? Because we want our kids to be generous people but we also want to create a sense of community and friendships for our kids. We volunteer our time because that’s what our parents did to model what a good parent does. Damn them!! 😂😂😂",

My goal for them is as much free time as possible. And as far as volunteering for stuff you literally couldn’t pay me to do…well you get the idea. Our culture’s illness is most rank and clearly observed in the way it treats childhood. I also want MY free time. As much as I can get!

I don’t even like a lot of the things I’m legally obliged to do(LOOKING AT YOU FORMAL EDUCATION, fukingbaneofmyexistencs). I model for these twerps(term of endearment, I also like “turdlings”) that authority is to be questioned always. This has made some things difficult, but at 14 and 17 I can honestly say that I don’t worry about them becoming loyal plastic robots for a world that doesn’t care. I’ve got a writer and a dancer/musician on my hands it seems. Neither life is easy, but they both went into it with open eyes. I encourage all of you to just stop doing this extra crap. Just stop. You don’t like it, your kids don’t like it. It is profitable, just not for you or them. Make them ride their bike to practice, or work and save money for sportsball gear. Make them prove their dedication. Let them discover on their own how valuable and precious free time actually is. My kids have had (when they’re with me) as much of this thing as the want. And they can’t get enough. What a privilege it is to have time to waste, don’t give that shit away!!",

We have discussed appropriate device use at school and will continue to do so.\n\nThat said, I have to admit I wasn’t especially shocked or alarmed to learn that my six-year-old searched the word “poop.” While we’ll continue reinforcing expectations around school technology, this struck me as typical developmental curiosity for a first grader rather than a serious behavioral issue. \n\nI trust that part of learning at this age includes gentle redirection and supervision, especially during device time. Please feel free to keep me posted if there are ongoing concerns — I’m always happy to work together to support him.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]",

We explained that we don’t use that kind of language in our home, it wasn’t present in his day care, we don’t even watch TV with the f word in it, so he must have learned it at school and asked what they were doing to find out where he learned it. I also pointed out that he didn’t even know what it meant and was probably just repeating what another kid said, and it wasn’t right to punish him without first telling him it isn’t acceptable and giving him a chance to do better next time. They insisted that he knew what he was saying and I pushed back and asked how they could possibly know that. \n\nWell, it turns out I was wrong. He absolutely knew what it meant. \n\nBecause the F word they were referring to was “Fart.” \n\n🤦‍♀️\n\nSeriously. If you can’t stand hearing the word Fart in your job you have no business working with children.",

If you have a room full of 20 kids and you supervise them all googling a historical figure, at least one of them is going to google poop or something that is not a historical figure. As a teacher, you’re circling the room trying to make sure everyone is at least googling and not playing a game. \n\nRegardless, if a student in my class googles the wrong thing or is messing around, I don’t contact parents unless it is a pattern. That student just loses their iPad for the day and needs to look on to the most focused student’s iPad that I can trust to follow instructions. \n\nI have never had to message parents for class time iPad use. I have however had to be involved in many meetings where students are sending harmful/hurtful messages to each other while at home and the aftermath bleeds into school hours. \n\nSounds like this teacher might be new and not know how to effectively manage iPads in his/her room. But to think a teacher sits 1:1 with every student to make absolute certain they cannot google poop is the only way it’s supervised technology time is bonkers.",

One time I clocked it at 45 minutes, meanwhile I can’t shit without our baby on my lap, and most recently a now toddler and 9 month old. I haven’t pooped alone in 3 years, meanwhile he somehow gets personal time on that porcelain throne.. It took a lot of conversations to get to the point where I no longer feel this way, because he will take our toddler out alone, pick up the slack and give me time needed because he knows what my days are like now because he has them too sometimes solo. He also knows after 5 minutes I’m gonna come bang on that door if I need to. Tell him it’s not an Internet cafe, or.. like one person said, meet at the door and go take some time running an errand. You manage to use the bathroom with littles so he can too. I still only take 90 second showers while my partner wakes and has some glorious 20 minute ones before work. Shit ain’t fair. And I work too. All day and then actually around his schedule.",

I do not post pictures of any other kids.\n\nI believe that this is a losing battle. We were at a school event and I bet my kids were on a lot of phones. Their photos were probably posted on social media sites. Some of which probably listed the name of the school. We went to the park after school. There were people taking pictures of what I assume was nature since they were paying more attention to the nature trails and pollinator areas than anywhere else. I have no idea if that’s all they took photos of. We go swimming at public pools and water parks - people take pictures there and kids are in bathing suits. Cameras are everywhere. I don’t blame parents who don’t post, but I do worry that some of them have a fake sense of security because of it. Teaching kids not to respond to their names if they don’t know a person and to not believe people no matter how much info they seem to know about them is a much better use of my time than not sharing those three photos from graduation to my 25 friends on Facebook. \n\nI have major issues with influencers who have millions of followers that have intimate knowledge of their houses and they share their kids. There’s a major difference in a kid being shared on a private Facebook page and a kid being victimized and used for profit.",

They're just random kids - no one on her Facebook is probably going to care about them.

All the baby learned was that he can be alone and cry in their crib, AND IT WILL BE OK.\n\nYou need to remind *yourself* about this too: A crying baby is not an emergency. \n\nIts ok for them to be upset. It’s ok for them to cry.\n\nGood parents dont go out of their way to create distressing situations for their kids, but they also dont try to avoid or fix every situation that is distressing to their kids. \n\nThey cried. You (eventually) responded, gave them tons of hugs and kisses, Im sure, and that was that. Its fine. Move on.\n\nBe sure to be aware of your projection of emotions too. Kids, and especially babies, take their cues about how to feel about things from you. If you act like what happened was terrible, baby may come away with the idea that “being alone and crying must be a really bad thing to be avoided at all costs.”\n\nApproach it like it was no big deal (without invalidating baby’s feelings about it), and baby will understand “it sucked, but its not the end of the world.”",

And I don’t mean that as an insult, I say it (as a man and a dad) with empathy.\n\nI care a hell of a lot about my kid, and I was a stay at home dad during the baby/toddler years, and I did a bang-up job of it.  But when I made a mistake or wasn’t paying attention for a moment and something happened, if the baby was OK, then I chalked it up to a learning moment and moved on.  Mom brains are torture chambers.  Y’all torment yourselves over every little oopsie.\n\nListen to your husband in this case.  You’re fine, you’re a good mama.  The bad parents don’t give a shit when something like this happens.  Bad parents drink eight glasses of wine so they CAN sleep through their baby crying.  Cut yourself just a tiny bit of slack and just be thankful your husband was there to get your back during this brief, uneventful lapse.\n\nIn fact, think about this: since your husband was actually around, you knew you had backup and your brain allowed you to keep sleeping.  Maybe if you were alone in the house you would have woken up.  Sure hubby was outside but he did hear the baby, right?  So you had backup and there’s no reason to question your instincts.",

And would have the nerve to ask us when we’d be refilling those cooking items. \n\nNow that she’s been on her own a bit. She’s marginally more respectful/understanding of where we’re coming from.",

        "body": "We had similar rules for my oldest. She did graduate high school, but beyond that, wasn’t interested in college or working anything more than a few hours a week. She refused to learn anything the easy way, and even though I know she listened when we tried to have these difficult entering-adulthood conversations with her, it just wasn’t landing. We didn’t have a bad relationship by any means, in fact we’ve always been really close. I’ll leave the specifics to your imagination, but I’m way too young to be her mom, and I always kind of struggled with wanting better for her but also feeling like a hypocrite because it’s not like she was born into a more stable or traditional environment. But I felt strongly that we’d be setting her up for failure if we enabled it, so we essentially (and lovingly!) told her to get it together or get out, and she chose to get out.\n\nThe first night she was in her new apartment I don’t think I slept a single minute, even though it was like a 7 minute drive from our house. It’s just so scary when your first baby flies the nest, and I felt like a terrible mom, both for pushing her out and also for feeling a tiny bit relieved about it. \n\nWell, we’re now 4 years later. It hasn’t been totally smooth sailing - she’s needed money, she’s needed emotional support, she’s needed her mama in every way a girl can need their mom. But she’s GROWN so much. She hustles. She budgets. She’s planning for her *life*, not just her right-now. She’s found her own friends outside of the kids she grew up with, and they’re awesome. She has three younger siblings, and I’ve even seen her grow so much in her relationship with them. I think her absence made her realize how important she is to them, and she has a newfound appreciation for that.\n\nShe moved a few hours away about a year and a half ago and that was somehow less tough than being a few minutes dow the road, because by then, I knew she’d be fine. She’s of course not done needing us (she’s only 22!), but I also hope she never will be, that’s what I’m here for. And it’s so rewarding to help her out when I know she’s busting her ass. It’s the same feeling of scooping up your toddler after a nasty fall. It’s not that complicated when they’re that little. There are no ulterior motives with anything they do. And just like that, I’m no longer annoyed that she needs help because I know she’s trying, I’m back to just feeling privileged that I’m the one who gets to catch her when she falls.\n\nEveryone’s path is different of course, but I hope it’s helpful to know that it really is the push some kids need. I’ll be crossing my fingers it’s the case for your kiddo!",

Despite all of the traits YOU have praised yourself instilling in him, you cannot help seeing him through this lens. And he sees himself the way you see him. \n\nMaybe your intentions have been good, but the means by which you are motivating may not be so well meaning.\n\nYou can tell him you love him all you want, but if you only ever acknowledge his negative traits (or it seems like that's what you mostly do) you are doing the opposite of motivating.\n\nYou and dad should take a step back and really see him. He's also the oldest - remember that there's something to birth order. Oldest siblings tend to have the world on their shoulders, and when your expectations aren't met they are incredibly vulnerable. They're expected to know better and to almost be a 3rd parent.You may very well not be seeing the things he DOES do. Let alone acknowledging them. You may think you've been fair to him but he may not see it that way.\n\nI have no doubt in my mind he wants you to be proud of him. But it sounds like he gets a lot of negative attention from the two of you (one reddit post can't encapsulate all of your parenting of course). \n\nHow long do you go without bringing up his responsibilities and his obligations?\n\nYou say the dishes weren't done correctly, but were they done at all? \n\nIs he diagnosed with anything that might impair his ability to focus and stay on task? If so, is that held to consideration when he doesn't meet expectations?\n\nWhere are you giving him the benefit of the doubt? I know kids can be full of shit and wtf do they know about real life?

When a parent, the most important person in a child's life, tells them for years that this is what they are, this is what they become .  Labels are horrifically  accurate self fulfilling prophecies. He needs you to build him up, not tear him down and tell him what an awful person he is .  And yeah, even if you did not say the literal words, there is no way he doesn't know this is what you think of him. I can't imagine describing my child with such contempt. \n\n When he comes back, and he will, and you'll take him back because he's your child, you need to start from scratch with a completely different attitude . You build him up, you help him plan,  you set clear boundaries all of which you have failed to do so fair . You acknowledge that as the parent you are always going to be the leader in the relationship, even when they are in their 20s or 30s . This does not mean enabling his paralysis . \nDo much better before you demand it from an inexperienced child who has no clue and had been told for years now , that he's incompetent",

I 100% agree that participating in peaceful protests, something future generations will be reading in THEIR textbooks (assuming the Magastapo doesn't burn them all), is far more important than whatever frivolous lesson is going on that day (and if a majority of the school is participating, they won't punish them all, let's be real.) And I say that also with a varsity athlete/college-class-taking student. A 4.0 GPA and flawless record ain't shit compared to being on the right side of history.

I supported any student that wanted to go. The first time I took no record of which students left (because these were my students and in an emergency I would be able to know who was present on campus but wasn't in my class) and the second time I had them sign out for emergency safety purposes only with full transparency that I would shred the list as soon as the bell rang. I hope other teachers would similarly be protective of their students safety and rights. \n\nMy own kids are younger (oldest is 7) but I think I would allow them to participate in a walk out as early upper elementary (5th or 6th grade) if they could sufficiently explain why and at that age if there was enough participation that my preteen would not be walking out alone.",

There are going to be people that come along that will cause problems no matter how careful you are. You can't let your fears drive you so far that you end up sheltering your kids or yourself. Trying to do so will only hurt you all worse than this incident hurt your child.\n\n\nIf your toddler says anything, reassure them that their daycare protected them this time, and will do so again if anything bad ever happened.

They'll be motivated to update their practices to avoid a similar situation in the future. And if you switch to a different daycare, who's to say that they'll have better security practices or clearer communication? Your current daycare has shown skill at deescalating and addressing the concern. And with some suggestion and reflection, they'll likely move to reduce the risk of a recurrence.\n\n* Something you could suggest for improved safety:\n* Doors are locked at all times. Must phone in to have a worker open the door.\n* Inquiries about new student registrations are handled either over the phone/email, or in person after hours when the centre does not have children present. Facility tours should be later in the process only after the safety of the individual has been established.",

I remind myself that logically my kids school is safe, they handle situations promptly and correctly and my child is taken care of. I will say that at our daycare you need 2 codes to get to the kids. There’s 1 code that everybody has their own code to enter the school and 1 code that everybody uses to pass the reception and get to their kids. Perhaps they could consider keeping the school locked during the day or installing some kind of keypad to allow parents to use a code to enter. You can suggest that and see if it’s an option",

Removing screens to allow time to reflect (as you mentioned in a comment) is a great foundation for the lesson to take hold. \n\nThere are absolutely ways to fix up damaged veneer, wood fill, pens, waxes. You mentioned that you and your son would likely enjoy the repair process, so maybe while getting the info and materials, talk to him on an emotional level about why it was hurtful. Explain what the table meant to you: a gathering place for the family to spend time together, etc, and what defacing it does to the excitement and joy of having something nice and new for the family to use together. Then work together to fix it. \n\nI’m going through something similar-kids (6 and 7) playing with a door and put a hole in the wall with the door knob. We explained what the house means to us and why taking care of it is important. We rent and had worked REALLY hard to get out of an apartment, getting into this house was an ordeal in and of itself. We have so many opportunities here that we would never have had otherwise. \n\nOnce they understood why the house mattered so much to us, they seemed more receptive to general upkeep and have been better about how they treat things. Before that they had a very blasé attitude when we talked to them about drawing on the walls, playing with doors etc. to them, it just didn’t seem like a big deal. They didn’t see the work it took to get here and don’t understand the work it takes to stay. \n\nAfter that, I taught them how to patch the wall and we did it together. This part was a lot of fun! I leaned in on how great it was that they were learning these skills, that they will know how to fix things themselves, the independence that it brings, and played up that they helped to repair our home. They have their own sense of pride in the house now, which is great! Personally, nothing hits quite like a home repair done well. That’s a sense of satisfaction that’ll never get old. \n\nWhile doing the repairs, I shared stories of learning to do similar things with my grandfather at their ages. Maybe they’re weird, but my kids have always enjoyed stories like that. They will tell me that they learned those things from Grandpa Dan too.  \n\nThey still won’t clean their room without putting up a fight though. YMMV. \n\nAnd who knows, maybe you have a future master whittler on your hands! Plenty of appropriate ways for kids to carve. If that’s something he is actually interested in, after he helps with any repairs or repayment, learning more about the trade and experimenting with it could be a fun outlet or hobby.",

We had a beat up table that we had forever. She never touched it, no scratching or coloring on it, nothing. We got a new costco table, not great because we knew she was still little but we needed something bigger. I even ordered a thick, clear vinyl cover for it, that was set to arrive the next day. The very first meal we ate at the table, she took her fork and scratched the sh*t out of the top. Like I said, she had never done it to the old table, it was like some kind of impulse to destroy the perfect surface.",

If one of them did something like this I would tell them why I was upset and make them understand why they shouldn’t damage furniture, then set clear boundaries that if they were to do something like that again then there would be consequences, give them a chance to correct their ways.",

I didn’t get upset.  I want to find a rational way to get through to him that it’s not okay.  I think having him help to fix the problem makes sure it doesn’t happen again instead of hoping the conversation does the trick.  Because, next time (when there HAS to be consequences) it might be a piece of furniture that I care about more.  I have lots of furniture that my father built and took a lot of pride in.  If any of that would have been damaged I’d be more upset.",

I can't imagine.\n\n\nThanks for the cry.\n\n\nMy story: there's a gas station nearby us that has one of those classic gumball machines with the big globe at the top and the swirly path that the gumball rolls down. Sometimes I take my kiddo there to buy stuff for her lunchbox I've been having an exceptionally tough week and I didn't/couldn't pack lunch for her. I imagine I usually look very drained when we go in. The gumball machine is right next to the cashier so she always asks me for quarters right there, and sometimes when the cashier clocks that I don't have any cash in my wallet (or as if recent, they clock that I'm paying with SNAP) and they'll just hand her a quarter. It's always so sweet.",

She’s kicking up a fuss and acting immature with her comments, tell her to cut it out, your decision is final.\n\nMy MIL posts little super cheesy “sayings” about being a grandma all the time because we don’t allow pics of our kids. It’s almost always her profile pic on WhatsApp. Things like “Grandchildren are life’s greatest blessing” - if you google “sayings about grandkids” you’ll find a bunch. Maybe this is something you could suggest to your mom as a compromise/alternative? It might satisfy her itch to post/brag about being a grandma.\n\nIf you trust her not to go rogue and post them online, we also share lots of pics of the grandkids with grandparents directly and have no issue with them showing those photos to friends in person or occasionally texting a pic or two to a friend. As long as it’s 1-to-1, not public on social media.",

I regret ever posting my kids anywhere.  The fact of the matter is your husband doesn’t want him posted so you lay down the law and tell everyone he’s not getting posted. If your mother really cares that much about letting people know her grandmother status than she can post a status…… lol. I totally get it with the older generation though. How bad your family wants to post your kid on Facebook is weird. And you should tell them that. Support your husband!",

We can control who is approved to see the photos and our parents can share the link with their friends to request access.

Not all employers are created equal though. My current employer is fantastic and understanding and I’ve never had issues with needing to work from home when my kid has been sick. Don’t give up hope, maybe you’ll be able to find a wfh or hybrid situation so that you can take care of your kiddo when needed and still be able to bring in income.",

I was working for a company for a few months and our son just kept getting sick and then it would pass around the family. I went on Christmas break that year for a few days and everything was great. It all seemed fine. My manager had even gifted me some books for my kids, totally unprompted and unexpected. When we came back after the holidays her entire demeanor had changed. She was talking about putting me on a PIP (performance improvement plan) and it all stemmed from my absence when my kids, or wife, or myself were sick. Nothing even particularly crazy here, we're talking about like 1.5 to 2 total weeks over a 9 month period. That entire time I had never heard word 1 about my performance, in fact I was frequently told the opposite and many of my colleagues openly talked about how productive they felt I was considering my situation.\n\nI was in a position to bail and so I did. The second I left that call with her and HR, I asked to speak to my HR rep directly and alone and I basically said forget this, forget you, you know this is bullshit but you won't ever admit it for legal reasons, etc. I told her I was quitting with no notice and to send me a return label for my work-issued equipment. My ex-manager actually had the gall to tell me I should hire a babysitter to watch my kids when they're sick so I can work, asked why my wife couldn't watch them, etc. Just completely insane behavior. I moved on and am in a better position for it but I had the luxury.\n\nI don't know what to say other than relay my own experience. Employers talk a big game but when the rubber meets the road they do not care at all about your kids, your family, or you beyond what they can extract from you.",

        "body": "I found a company that is remote and family first. Maybe a golden goose egg in Corporate America, but it's been great. So long as i'm billing 40 hours a week and meeting client needs (as well as meetings) it doesn't matter when I work. I have put kiddo to bed and then sat on my work computer for 2 hours working. \n\nI work for a marketing agency helping stand up CRM's and onboard/train teams.\n\nWith all that- It is still very challenging trying to work and do childcare when she's home sick. Mine is in daycare during the day but when she gets sent home it is very hard to do both and then I fall behind in work.  My work is a bunch of moms and dads even in upper management so they are more family first but -America is built on Corporatism and driving materialistic revenue. It has been very frustrating even in my role to see the reality of this. \n\nI agree with toughing it out if and if they fire you, collect that unemployment and look for another job or become a SAHM.",

Go home for 2 days. One instance of diarrhea? Sent home in case there’s more. Drives me up a wall. \n\nI get asked often when I’d consider another in-office job, but with kids getting sent home so much and me being able to actually handle it, there’s not many practical reason for me to look at the moment.",

For example, stick to one activity - don't let all three children do their own sport AND visit different friends daily AND expect dinner to be cooked, homework to be done, laundry to be washed and neatly folded, and the house spotless. Not gonna happen - it isn't practical. Put all the children into one or no after school activity, and they can each have two playdates a month. Parties count as a playdate. It means saying no and sorry sometimes and perhaps often... and it's still a LOT to do although it sounds like not very much!\n\nAnd, gently... at this age... *you* have to be the one to check the backpacks each night. Keep a large paper calendar high up where children can't easily write over it and put important events on that immediately as each flyer comes home. (Dry erase boards don't work long-term for obvious reasons.) But I do keep a dry erase board on the fridge for \"things to buy\" each week, so if your children need silly socks for next week it can go right there and hopefully you remember to buy them on your next outing. If not, showing up on silly sock day without the silly socks is NOT the worst thing that can happen. Your children are loved and cared for and they live in an ordered home - that is number one always.\n\nYou've got this :)",

DH's take on it was, \"We could do it, but it would probably kill us\", and he was right.\n\nThe only other (completely unrealistic) option was to hire a part- or full-time nanny or au pair, which wouldn't be possible unless we dipped into our savings or I went back to work full-time instead of on an occasional basis, which would impact our ability to spend time with any of our children.\n\nI would still like another child, or even more if we could swing it, but given our limitations and the fact that it's not only expected for parents to put more time into parenting than in the past, but I think it's generally better for the kids (my own divorced mother had very little time for us and it wasn't a good situation), I think we'll just continue to focus on the two we have and enjoy them.\n\nI know people who have had that 'extra' child and made it work, and that's great, but realistically, we don't have the resources to do so. There are a lot of blessings in our lives already, so we keep focused on those rather than on what we don't have.",

They also have 3 very different interests for extra curricular activities.  It is 100% overwhelming sometimes.\n\nA few things I find helpful:\n\n1. Make friends with your kid’s friends moms and put your kids in the same activities.  You can carpool and coordinate play dates before and after. \n\n2. Limit activities or days they do activities. \n\n3. I put 18369855 reminders in my phone.  Any email I get with dates for spirit days, snack help, apts, sign ups for camp.  They are all in my phone. Plus I have a big calendar in my kitchen.\n\n4. Sometimes I have them all have friends over at the same time so it gets 3 play dates in one done plus I can typically get housework done when they are all distracted by friends.\n\n5. I just say no sometimes. I can only do so much\n\nHope that helps. Good luck.",

Is he still happy with those purchases. Or the $500 you spent on Starbucks getting snacks every week. Super fun in the moment but now that's gone. Do you want to do that again, or have that $500 in savings that could be put towards an fancy vacation, a car, the ability to take summers off vs working a minimum wage job to help pay for college courses.\n\nWith the hopes that he gets the shopping spree out of his system.

Meaning it has to come from her allowance or gifts given to her. Otherwise she doesn’t really understand how much money she is really using. Cash is something tangible and ‘hurts’ to use. \n\nShe is also allowed to buy bigger items, but again, half the money needed to come from somewhere else. She bought a Nintendo Switch 2, and half that money came from birthday money. \n\nShe is obvi younger than your son, and therefore this might not be realistic for you.

You want to teach the principles of dividing money up so when the time comes for him to learn to budget, he’ll have some good financial literacy. That way, he can split his allowance as such going forward. \n\nI was taught to save, but my parents rewarded me by letting me spend large(ish) amounts of money when goals were met.

Would they not have sufficient cloths had they not made this money?\n\nMy dad put all my internship money in an IRA for me (you can put $7k per year). That's 50k+ 10 years later tax-free. The concept of splurging or \"I have money, so I deserve to to spend some of it to feel good\" is really kind of nonsensical. Like you worked hard for this, why give it away to someone else?",

I could tell you what I would do, but my life and circumstances are not the same. What I would say is that you should try to separate emotion and reality. You have gone through a lot, losing your dad is a big deal, adding that to the sleepless nights and busy days of early toddlerhood you are in a particularly difficult time. Making a decision when you are at your lowest isn't always ideal. Are your marital problems a result of the stress on your life now or do you think even when things calm down it won't recover? Would you want this baby if life wasn't so overwhelming right now or does the thought of adding another even in the best circumstances overwhelm you? Are your feelings of guilt over the thought of abortion due to unnecessary pressure on yourself or do you really feel strongly that this isn't the right decision? Only you can answer those questions, but try to do so with the frame of reference of \"What would i want to do outside of the grief I'm currently feeling?\"",

She came out very very much looking like my grandfathers side of the family. She had a very prominent “angel’s kiss” birthmark at birth. My grandmother had slipped into depression after his death, but as soon as she knew the baby was coming she perked back up and started talking about the future again. When we’d meet her. \n\nIt is somehow harder when parenting wasnt your choice - when you didn’t enthusiastically choose and plan this.

        "body": "My oldest took several years and losses to conceive. We were about to move to IVF when I finally got pregnant. Funny enough, it was shortly after my grandma passed away. I’m still positive she got upstairs and gave someone an earful about getting us pregnant, because that’s just the kind of woman she was. During all of our testing we were told the chances of naturally conceiving were less than 1%. \n\nJust after my oldest turned one I found out I was pregnant. It was literally a single night in about 2 months and I was randomly pregnant. I don’t know if any moment of my life was more shocking than when 2 pink lines showed on that stick. \n\nI spent the entire pregnancy wracked with guilt. I finally had my miracle baby and now I to learn how to love another kid as much as I loved her. I constantly switched back and forth between being so incredibly thankful for another and wishing I’d never gotten pregnant again. And my 2nd pregnancy was more medically complicated. The minute she was born I was instantly in love with her though. But it was by far one of the hardest periods of my life. \n\nAnd then when my middle was 9mon old we found out we were pregnant with our 3rd, again a one night fluke. So come early Covid, I was a momma to 3 kids, basically under 3. I don’t regret any of it. Maybe spacing so close together? But also I don’t feel like I really had any control over that at the same time. Now they’re 5, 7 and 8 and they are eachothers best friends.",

She would sometimes get pregnant but had well over a dozen miscarriages. So finally at 48, the doctors decide to take her out of the bio equation all together and they finally have twins with a surrogate, egg donor and her husband's sperm.\n\nOne year later, I shit you not, after all that she spontaneously gets pregnant. She went through many of the same thoughts as you, and ultimately decided to continue the pregnancy fully believing that she'd miscarry somewhere along the way. At 50 years old, she gave birth to a perfectly healthy baby girl with no complications. She went from believing that she would never have kids to having 3 in as many years. The twins are 8 and her daughter is 6 now.\n\nI don't know how she's doing it - I am the same age as her (mid-50's) and my daughter had graduated from college before the twins were even born. They struggle a bit as older parents, but for the most part are a happy, loving family with lots of support from extended family.",

But said traumatic loss wreaked havoc on my body and messed with my hormones and affected ovulation. And in the throes of PTSD symptoms (flashbacks that were so vivid it was with all my senses and I was back there, panic attacks, unimaginable suffering) and borderline feeling like I didn’t want to be here (not that I wanted to die but I just didn’t want to feel this kind of visceral pain)….that baby is the best thing that ever happened to me. She brought hope and joy for so many people, not just me. \n\nAt the time it felt like she couldn’t have come at a worse time, but it was absolutely meant to be. The logical thing would’ve been to end the pregnancy. There seemed to be more cons than pros. We were BROKE (washing our dishes in a bathtub because our rental had no kitchen, cooking on a hot plate broke). My husband was still in school, I was a year into my career, our family didn’t live locally, we had no idea how we would handle any of it. But through stubbornness and sheer delusion everything would work out I kept going…and by a miracle it did \n\nThis baby might not feel like a blessing right now, but if there is ANY chance you want to keep it, do. If you change your mind and decide to go for a third later the chance this happens again is slim to none",

Not my thing.  \n\nI do love scrabble and boggle, but my whole little family is math minded and hates those, of course.",

We have a lot of overlap in our music taste, but we frequently tell each other, \"Just one time only because you like it.\" Before belting our hearts out together singing along. Parents that pretend to like things their child likes are weird.\n\n\nOn another note, my mom has been a lifelong marijuana user. I (a hard-core stoner from 16-24) did not find out unit I was 20 when her bestie offered me a spot in the circle. I used to think that my mom hiding out in my parents room right after getting off work was just decompression and getting ready to handle us brats. Now I know she was decompressing and inhaling.\n\n\nThe  dark secret used to be why her mom and I separated back when she was a baby. Back then her mom saw punches as the answer to her problems. I gave an ultimatum about never hittjng me again and to be fair she made it about a year (including the pregnancy). It's not an issue anymore, but I let it slip out on a phone call making a joke with friend from that time with her in the car. Lead to some important conversations about abuse and how even the people you trust can be abusers. Now the dark secret is what I was up to the night we conceived her. I stole tires from a junkyard, snuck into her grandma's house, then left to go sell the last illegal drugs I ever sold. Many of my family and friends know this so I'm hoping nobody mentions it until my daughter is an adult. 🤞",

My son will also do the same with my other nostalgia like \"Forgot About Dre\" and \"Ms Jackson\".  In return I allowed them to listen to Taylor Swift and Imagine Dragons sometimes uuuuuuggggghhhhhh.\n\nI was invited to the smoke circle when I was 16 and it forever changed my relationship with my dad.

They are really sweet its just too much travel for them. \n\nMy parents are 15 minutes from my house, they probably see my kids 3 times a week. Wednesdays they pick my oldest up from school and he then spends the afternoon and dinner with them (the little guy is 2 so its fun for him to have alone time), then on Thursday my brother and I bring our littlest kids (they are 2 almost 3) to my parents apartment and we hang out and have lunch together. My parens are in good shape but older and don't need to be extended watching really little guys\n\nWe usually see them once on the weekend as well. They will also watch the kids in a pinch if I have a doctors appointment, but I do try to get a real sitter to go out at night because I mean... they are 76 and my 2 year old is a LOT of kid.",

They haven't suggested or planned any visits. We live a longer flight away, but I am a bit surprised they aren't trying to visit once a year - maybe around his birthday, or their birthdays, or Christmas or something? We also initiate all phone and videocalls. \n\nI don't know what they're thinking - they're in their 70s and this is the only grandchild they're getting, and they've already missed so much. I'm putting more effort into it than I think I should, but I really valued my relationship with my grandparents effects though my parents didn't always have a great relationship with them, so I want to give my child the same chance. My parents only took me to see my grandparents two or three times before we ended up moving in with them when I was 10, but I was lucky enough to have 20 years after that to build with them. I don't think my parents have 20 years left, so it's now or never and they seem to be leaving towards never.",

He came between meals, didn't want to go out and do something (not even to the park a few blocks away), he just sat in my living room in a chair and talked with me, and he would interact with her if she initiated it. He didn't really seem to want to BE the grandpa, just make sure his line lives in and get the bragging rights that he saw one of his grandkids. \n\n\nHe didn't see her again until she was 4, when I traveled to his state for my brother's memorial service. His wife was more interested than he was, and I kept playing interference because that woman is horrid and kept trying to coach my daughter to call her Nana. Absolutely not, she has a Nana already. Anyway, that was the last time he saw any of us. I cut contact with him a couple years later, in 2018. ",

I grew up with a Gram who lived 7 blocks away and was heavily involved in my day to day.",

It wasn’t until my teacher showed us some pictures or Emmett Till in his casket and had us read what his mother told to the news paper about why she made those pictures that we finally shut up.

I think he would maybe enjoy theater, we have one that has a summer camp we hope to sign him up for this coming summer! To answer your question if he has interest in anything…he likes playing monopoly, plays with legos, and RC cars. But those are just things he passes time with but I want him to find something that he can work at and feel like he is being successful with it if that makes sense. I want him to find something he enjoys and wants to practice getting good at. I don’t care what it is, just something that drives him.",

        "body": "D&D or other ttrpgs could be a great thing. It's a shared activity so it's very social, you win or lose together, and even \"losing\" is a bonding opportunity. You can always participate. Getting better means you develop a better understanding of tactics, you get better at playing your character or even starting to create your own stories and challenges for other players. The only tip I want to give is to really vibe check the table. Some people consider themselves \"hardcore gamers\" and are there to crunch the numbers and expect everyone to really play a certain way. On the other end of this spectrum people see it as a substitute for improv theater where the rules matter less than the story being told. Both in excess can be offputting if you're not into that (and could create scenarios where you do feel like you're left out or are not good enough). But, simply asking the DM/GM (the one who runs the game) should be informative enough. If the DM/GM is not helpful or doesn't want to engage with questions, stay away. \n\nGames can often be found through libraries, game shops and digital communities specific to finding gaming groups.",

He likes reading. Get him plenty of books. I could spend all day reading at that age. I was valedictorian of my class. Have several degrees and awards now. Don’t pressure the poor guy at this age. He may just be a big introvert who loves book and cripples under competitive stuff like sports. I was that kid.

On our ride home tonight when he was tearful about spending most of his basketball game on the bench I said what matters is if you’re having fun with it, and if practices are still fun then it’s worth doing and if it’s not then we can find something else. Hence me looking for something else. But you have to admit an 11 year old can’t spend every minute of his free time reading, we need variety. Even though he loves reading, he’ll only do it for awhile and then wants to do something else. So it’s not like I’m tearing a book out of his hands forcing him into something else.",

And i learned this as an adult so i had to create a change in the way i speak.  Sometimes that can come off insincere despite a persons intentions.  And of course, maybe he just doesn't like it.  Here's a related but off topic experience i had with AI.  Sometimes she keeps talking when i'm trying to write down or think about what we've been discussing.  She always has to have the last word.  I say, thank you, dont reply or speak so that i can write this down before i forget it.  And she replies with a verbose...  i understand, keeping notes is a good idea, i'll wait until you .....    OMG  it's insane.  I tell that silly personal story to say, some people aren't morning people.  If his needs are met and he just needs a minute to wake up, he might not like mommy calling the play by play.  Just make sure he knows you're there and that he's on track if that's necessary, and let him be.  You're gonna have a big personality there.  I love it!  Enjoy !",

I could never be with someone who doesn’t care if my child is safe.\n\nETA: I just saw your edit saying he is biologically their parent. I want to say: this is not how a parent acts.

What was he actually *doing* that was so important he couldn’t ensure his kids safety\n\nThe refusal to talk unless you are ‘calm’ is concerning though. He isn’t entitled to you not having feelings about this and being unable to express them to your partner and father of your children is alarming. \n\nCould be way off base but sounds like this man is someone who doesn’t take responsibility for his actions and deflects on to other people when he knows he did something wrong. If this is a pattern of behaviour I would be suggesting it’s time rethink this relationship",

If something were to have happened to that 6 year old, your partner (and likely your entire family) would be under intense scrutiny for letting him out and not going after him. I imagine there would be formal charges against your partner too. Think about that for a second.",

They were definitely things I would normally have just done myself or let slide to keep peace but I've had enough of shouldering the responsibility for kids. (For example, my son has food aversions so won't eat most vegetables. My partner will serve him a meal that's just meat and then I'll go and chop up some fruit to accompany it. Saw the plate last night before we'd sat down for dinner so asked him to add fruit. He said 'you usually do that'. I said 'I usually do that because you don't, not because it's solely my job.' And then he got huffy and said he preferred it when I did it, though grudgingly did it.)\n\nAnd then this. And his excuse was that he couldn't find the car keys, which is because I'd left them in my work bag (which was at house). It definitely feels like he was trying to punish me, which scares me more than if it was just ignorance (and that freaks me out enough in terms of trust).",

My kids do know they’re allowed to say they don’t like it, but only after they try it once. Typically they like it once they try it. I try and service at least something they’ll eat though. Fruit with every meal or possibly some of their favorite snack on the plate with the dinner. Sometimes my smaller one (4) will flat out refuse the meal in which case I offer her something easy like a PB&j or cheese quesadilla but it’s not the go to. I think the low pressure and the ‘this is just the way it is’ attitude helps us. I will say my older (6) has never given us attitude about it and she loves lots of unusual food for her age (raw oysters, clams, ceviche, etc) but I also think it’s cuz we gave them to her early on.

Make what you want and offer your kid what you have, they won't starve.\n\n\nObviously there are exceptions but a lot of parents are overthinking this. Just chill out about it and if the kiddo complains they're hungry then point out you had food to eat but they didn't partake.  Do not give in and make them something they want, because that just encourages bad behavior.\n\n\nGetting to a middle ground where you make sure some food you serve you know they like is perfectly fine, but honestly your kid will not die if they skip dinner.\n\n\nThis can be a never ending battle if you choose to make it, and you will have much bigger fish to fry in the future.

For example, if we do a stir fry and all they eat is rice and chicken, and no veggies, that’s fine. We trust that us eating diverse meals together night after night is enough to get them interested over time and get them what they need. We don’t serve them a « safe » meal if they don’t eat much but they’ll often have fruit  as dessert. \n\nThe other thing we try to do if serve them a breakfast and/or lunch that is more geared to their established preferences. That way, there’s less pressure on dinner. \n\nGood luck! ",

I always make sure there is something on her plate I know she will eat. Example, last night we had chicken fried rice (with asparagus, peas, carrots). I served hers with a side of carrot sticks and strawberries. She had 1 bite of rice (no chicken, no eggs, no carrots. Just rice). But she ate all of the strawberries and carrot sticks. \n\nBetween breakfast, lunch, dinner , and snacks, I know she’s getting enough to eat throughout the day. So even though dinner was light/ snack like, she got enough to eat that I don’t worry ab ooh t the individual meal and it allows me to continue to expose her to more foods.",

        "body": "I wish someone had told me that bearing witness to your children's social lives would be one of the TOUGHEST things about parenting!  That was perhaps the biggest surprise for me.\n\nI think every parent encounters some kind of social “thing” with their kid at some point. It can happen to any child, at any age. I’ve seen it everywhere—my nephew was suddenly dropped by his close friend group in high school with no explanation, my son went through a painful friend breakup in early elementary school, and I was the “weird kid” myself, the child of immigrant parents who never quite fit in.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve been very intentional about teaching my kids social and friendship skills. Role-playing how to enter a conversation, invite someone to play, or ask questions about others—like several parents here suggested—really works when kids are young enough to lean into it.\n\nI also *love* the book **Growing Friendships: A Kids’ Guide to Making and Keeping Friends** and highly recommend it.\n\nOne mantra I’ve always shared with my kids is: *“The key to having friends is to always be making new ones.”* We live in a city where families move frequently, and I could see early on that one of my daughter’s close friends had a pattern of intense friendships followed by sudden drop-offs. I knew it would eventually happen, so I made sure my daughter was building multiple friendships at the same time.\n\nWhen that friendship ended in early middle school, it was a soft landing. She had practiced social skills, built a wider circle, and set her own goals around friendship—despite being naturally introverted.\n\nI’ll be honest: a lot of this took behind-the-scenes effort—leading her scout troop, hosting playdates, initiating with other parents. It’s a delicate balance: supportive without pushing, involved without hovering. I didn’t always get it right 😉, but it mattered.",

She never asks for friends to come over/go out with us and for a long time I thought something was wrong until I chaperoned her school field trip a couple of years ago and almost every kid in her class (and other classes) was kind to her: walking down the hall kids would greet her by name, unprompted! They were all so friendly and chatty. She does scouts, she plays sports, she plays an instrument in after-school orchestra, plus school--lots of opportunities to socialize. But she likes being alone sometimes...actually most of the time when she has a choice. She needs a lot of downtime to recharge when she's not forced to be a part of a group. And I realized that my perception of her social situation was (1) somewhat inaccurate and (2) bothering me a lot more than it was bothering her. I had to accept that she and I are different people with different needs and experiences of childhood. So I would use the tips people are giving you to talk to her and see if she's actually bothered by what you're seeing, or if she's blissfully unaware that she's on the fringes, or if she's happy with how things are, and you may be surprised. But be open to accepting how she perceives the situation and she feels about how things are going socially. Six is still really young and kids are just beginning to grasp group dynamics.",

I have known many, many kids who would hang around other kids playing, waiting to be invited. I have never known a single kid who *noticed* this and invited the kid. They’re just not that aware of what else is going on around them when they’re having fun. The good news is, when I coached the shy/loner kid to ask to play, the vast, vast majority of the time, the playing kids will say “sure!” and welcome them in.\n\nHelp her ask to play ( assuming that she wants to play with kids). Role play with her at home. I think it would be a good idea to talk to her teacher about it, too. The teacher may not be out at recess with her, but should still be able to support and encourage her before and after recess, and possibly can even talk to the aide/recess supervisor about it (just to manage your expectations on that, though, if there are behaviors or safety issues on the playground the aide isn’t going to be able to help with social coaching).\n\nGood luck to you and your daughter! I was a super lonely kid, so I hope your daughter is more of a loner by choice than lonely. I am sure it must hurt terribly for you to see her like that.",

Not really introverted at all, but when it came to play time, it was just a little harder for her to connect because she was very rigid with what her idea of fun was and she wasn't willing to compromise. She's still like this to an extent, but she's in 3rd grade now and this is the first year that she's really had a friend in class to consistently hang out with. Luckily it's never bothered her much. Sometimes it was a little bit sad but it was nice see her stick to her guns and not really be swayed by peer pressure on what to do with her free time. \n\nIt's weird because she really is very well liked overall, her teachers have all said that they try to pair her with shy kids to get them to open up. Making friends was not hard, but playing with them was always a challenge.\n\nHave you asked your kiddo how she feels about the situation? Perhaps it bothers her less than you'd think?",

I could see the smoke and/or dust on the horizon at my house even though I didn’t live close. A kid in my high school lost his father, his mom was a stay at home mom and he had something like 5 siblings. A bunch of other kids lost aunts, uncles, and cousins. A ton more kids had first responder or police in NYC parents.\n\nPlease don’t take this as judgment, this is the first time I’ve ever heard “I don’t care” about it. But it makes sense to me that teens who didn’t know anyone personally affected wouldn’t care. I assume it felt so far removed that it was like it wasn’t real.",

  "summary_text": "- r/Parenting has no celebrated topics — the community is driven by problem-solving and shared anxiety rather than celebration\n- The phrase \"year old\" is the most common bigram, establishing that age-specific advice is the community’s primary function\n- **iPad** appears as the top named entity, suggesting screen time is the defining parenting debate of this generation\n- \"Feel like\" and \"sounds like\" dominate the language patterns, indicating a community built on empathy and validation\n- At 51% negative content, the community runs substantially negative — parents come here with problems, not victories\n\nWith a mean sentiment of -0.295, r/Parenting is a space where exhausted parents seek reassurance, and the data confirms this at every level. The top bigrams — \"year old,\" \"feel like,\" \"sounds like,\" \"every day,\" \"make sure\" — read like the building blocks of supportive advice-giving. This is a community whose primary interaction mode is empathetic validation.\n\nThe **iPad** dominance in entity mentions is a generational marker. Screen time has become the parenting issue, displacing older concerns about nutrition or discipline as the thing parents feel most uncertain about. **Epstein** appearing in the entity list likely reflects a specific news-driven conversation about child safety that generated intense discussion during the analysis period.\n\nThe absence of celebrated topics is the most telling finding. Parenting communities might be expected to celebrate milestones or share joys, but r/Parenting functions almost exclusively as a support group. **Reddit** sitting in divisive territory suggests the community is itself a topic of meta-discussion — members debating whether the platform is a healthy source of parenting advice.",

          "selftext": "I love my son. He is the oldest of four. I have spent most of his life teaching him how to do basic household chores, he can cook, he's smart enough to look things up but he is also a slob, lazy, rude, and puts the least amount of effort into everything he does.\n\nHe turned 18 about 6 months ago. My husband (his dad) and I have both been pretty clear about our expectations for our kids once they turn 18.\nAs long as they were attending school or attempting to get employment, helping around the house, taking care of their hygiene and laundry,  and being respectful of our house, rules, and other family members they could stay at home as long as they wanted. They just needed to be on some path forward. \n\nWell my son hasn't been doing much of anything. He told us he wanted to move in with his girlfriend who lives about a block away. He wanted to move there a couple of months into the relationship, with multiple other roommates one of whom doesn't like my son and seems like he's jealous of his relationship with his girlfriend, he has no GED (he was kicked out of the GED program he was attending for not making any progress in months), and no job.\n\nMy husband and I told him it was probably not a great idea and shared our concerns but that it was his choice. He wasn't too happy we were honest. He has spent weeks saying he was getting his area ready and he would be moving soon. He was getting up early every morning and spending all day over there. He literally was coming home to poop and sleep. He rarely eats here because he's been cooking for his girlfriend. \n\nI had a surgery a little over a week ago and can't do any housework for 6 weeks. I told him that I would need help from him and his brothers. He said he would help. He was supposed to do dishes and they weren't getting done. We got into an argument 5 days after a major surgery because for the 5th day in a row the dishes weren't cleaned properly. This has been an ongoing issue for years of I'm being honest. I honestly don't get how he can't do it but his younger brothers, who have been taught the same way, can get the dishes clean and he can't. \n\nToday we had a family meeting. We talked to everyone about chores and then we sat down with my oldest to discuss what was happening with him moving. He instantly blew up. When my husband finally got mad, my son had the audacity to laugh, so we told him he needed to pack his things and leave. \n\nHe has been getting more and more disrespectful over the past several months because we would check in with him and see what his plans were; if he was actually moving, if he has looked into finishing his GED (he has one test) or been studying, if he's been applying for jobs, etc. \n\nSo he grabbed some of his belongings and went to his girlfriends. He came back later to get more of his stuff and apologize. My husband and I explained that we loved him, that it really sucked that it got to this point, that we would be here if he needed anything, that he was welcome here, but that we weren't going to keep taking crap when all we are trying to do is motivate him to do something productive and give our opinions. \n\nIf he needed to move back, he could, but he would need to show us that he can be at least a little more responsible, definitely more respectful, and more helpful. It hurts but I don't think we were wrong.\n\n",
