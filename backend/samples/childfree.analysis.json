I wish I could be sexless, I wish I could live in a body that was MINE, that didn't work against me. \n\n\nEdit: I didn't even think of babies themselves before, but compared to other species' children, human babies are completely dependent on their mothers, so a woman has to be sleep deprived and constantly feeding it to keep the human race going lol ", "author": "North_Bike5693", "score": 1102, "num_comments": 158, "created_utc": 1770954115.0, "permalink": "/r/childfree/comments/1r3eo4i/i_really_hate_having_a_female_body/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1r3eo4i/i_really_hate_having_a_female_body/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.9159544110298157, "compound_score": -0.9103, "scores": {"negative": 0.916, "neutral": 0.0784, "positive": 0.0057}}}, {"post": {"id": "1qucqfw", "subreddit": "childfree", "title": "Men wanting a “legacy”", "selftext": "I’ve had MULTIPLE men I’ve dated tell me that they want children to leave a “legacy”… Do they think they’re f\\*ckin’ Rockefellers or something? 🤣 The only things they’re leaving their children are late stage capitalism and societal and environment collapse lol Gives me such an ick when I hear men say that!", "author": "Lost_Camera_L3ns_Cap", "score": 1100, "num_comments": 118, "created_utc": 1770078097.0, "permalink": "/r/childfree/comments/1qucqfw/men_wanting_a_legacy/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1qucqfw/men_wanting_a_legacy/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.7363977432250977, "compound_score": -0.7128, "scores": {"negative": 0.7364, "neutral": 0.24, "positive": 0.0236}}}, {"post": {"id": "1qq3rn8", "subreddit": "childfree", "title": "I don’t have to be human shield just because I don’t have children", "selftext": "I just read a thread online about ICE.

They are good people and in the right position in life to have children. I am sad that most probably I will lose them to children, but I want them to be happy. But they have issues conceiving. They've tried for several years the normal way, then they turned to IVF travelling to other parts of the country trying to get to the right clinics. Last year the woman got pregnant with twins and later miscarried. This year she is pregnant again with twins. She is so tiny and fragile that I am scared how her body can handle not one but two babies. She has complications which require additional procedures. She needs to be careful and rest, so she's staying at home. We invited them to a place where they could come by car and she needs to walk like 200m. They still denied. She is usually very social, always wants to be out and active, but now she is afraid to even leave home. And she is due in May. Those are 4 more months of house arrest basically. I am afraid for her wellbeing - both physical and mental. A regular pregnancy is already hard on the body and this is twins pregnancy with complications. Even if they want kids I fail to see how risking her own wellbeing in such a drastic way is justified. What if she doesn't make it through the delivery? What if babies come out premature and don't even have normal lives? What if she miscarries again and spirals mentally? Her body is telling her it can't produce babies but she pushes if further. Why??\n\nSecond story:\nA couple which constantly pops in my YouTube feed (as I am in breeding age and the algorithm is pushing all this crap on me) and somehow got me invested in their story. Again beautiful people who would be great parents. Again attempting to get pregnant for a long time, couple rounds of IVF, complications, etc. Unlike my friend, the woman had complications even before getting pregnant and had to go through different treatments. Complications only kept showing up with advancing pregnancy. Every possible rare case issue they are warned she might have becomes true. She is at week 25 of pregnancy and already stuck in hospital until the end of the pregnancy. She would need planned C-section earlier than her due date, because if she starts giving birth naturally and they are not prepared it's super possible that she won't make it. They are also afraid of another condition which they can't determine for sure if she has, but if she has it serious bleeding is expected and she needs to get hysterectomy during birth to save her life. So she is stuck in hospital for 2+ more months (if something doesn't mess up earlier) and fully aware that serious issues which can kill her are very possible during birth. And they are praying for a healthy baby. Like wtf, pray that your wife will make it out of this self-induced deadly health risk alive. \n\nI can understand that some people want children. I know some of them can be great parents. But putting your own life at risk for a child which doesn't even exist when your body gives you clear signs to stop with this bs... And the men - what if your wife dies because of this - how will you ever forgive yourself?

I have taken training and certification to rehabilitate wildlife. I spent a decade working and learning animal first aid and other skills to focus on this and animal welfare in general. I have personally saved, released, or found homes for over 100 injured, abandoned or homeless animals. Opossums, turtles, squirrels, deer, dogs, cats... you name it.\n\n When I was able to buy my first home a few years ago, I could have bought a nice brick home in a cute subdivision on a quarter-acre. Instead I used my budget to buy a used manufactured home on 16 acres, just so I could leave 15 of those acres completely alone and allow nature and wildlife to have space. When I moved here, I saw no fireflies, no bees, no butterflies. I set out to change that. In the four years I've been here, I have planted pollinator-friendly flowers, gotten rid of light pollution, and put out pollinator feeding stations. Its working. I watch as the butterflies and bees land on the clover where only grass used to be. I listen to the birds that come by to eat the seeds I lay out for them. Seeds they will drop here and there creating new growth. The squirrels and their offspring that I've had a hand in saving are still out there, forgetting where they hid their nuts and seeds, which creates 25% of the trees that provide the very air we all breathe. Just like the opossums I've released and their offspring are still out there, stopping the spread of the many diseases that only such scavengers of nature can prevent. I've placed loving dogs and cats into homes. Homes of lonely elderly people who did have children but yet somehow, have nobody to care for them in their last years. So if you think having children guarantees you'll have care, think again. If not for the heartbeat at their feet that I provided, a lot of older people would spend every day completely alone just wishing their children would come visit. That animal is their only companion. \nSo go ahead and tell me that I'll regret it. Tell me I'm selfish. Tell me I'm not leaving part of myself behind. Tell me I won't have anyone to take care of me when I'm old. Say all the things. Have your children if you like.

Before that I used to work at an amusement park. It is thanks to that job that I have become accustomed to interacting with overly permissive, irrational and entitled parents. \n\nIn comes a family with 3 toddlers. The mom has an infant in one of those baby carriers, and the dad is pushing a stroller with (you guessed it) another baby. \n\nThe toddlers, by no fault of their own, are acting like toddlers. They’re hyper, they’re screaming, they’re chasing each other and trying to tackle one another to the ground. \n\nUsually when I have to deal with these kinds of parents, they’re intentionally ignoring their kids because “there’s no reason I’m not allowed to enjoy myself because I’m a parent now” and blah blah blah. But these parents were just… totally out of it. I don’t know if it was because they were more focused on the infants or what, but they were outright clueless and oblivious. Like they had collective ADD. \n\nOne of the ship’s spare anchors is on display. The toddlers immediately start climbing it. There’s a huge sign that says “do not climb” but toddlers aren’t exactly known for being literate so they’re not really at fault here. The parents meanwhile are paying attention to other things. \n\n“Get down from the anchor please,” I call out. As expected the tots don’t listen. “Make sure your kids aren’t climbing the anchor.” No response from the parents. “Parents, get your kids down NOW, that is not for climbing.” (I can’t help but raise my voice when someone, especially kids, are in near-immediate danger.) Finally, the mom says something to the toddlers, and they get down. They go downstairs to another part of the exhibit. For the next several minutes I can hear the toddlers banshee wailing and stomping along the metal floors. Eventually they come back up again, and the toddlers ONCE AGAIN start climbing up the anchor like it’s a jungle gym. \n\nAnd the same thing happens again. “Please get down,” toddlers don’t process my words, parents are paying attention to something else, “Please get your kids down,” still nothing from the parents. And I can’t help but lose it a little. “GET YOUR KIDS OFF THE ANCHOR, IT’S NOT FOR CLIMBING. STOP LETTING THEM CLIMB THE ANCHOR!” \n\nThese interactions tend to always end with me being treating to the parent going into an absolute rage and screaming and cussing in my face. They give the whole “THEY’RE KIDS, THEY DON’T KNOW ANY BETTER, YOU DON’T GET IT BECAUSE YOU’RE NOT A PARENT, DON’T TELL ME HOW TO PARENT MY KIDS.” \n\nI get lucky this time. It seems they were too out of it to yell at me. \n\nLurking parents - most of the time when people complain about kids in public, it’s not really about the kids. It’s about the parents not parenting, letting their kids be completely out of control, and viciously defending their lack of action everytime they behave in a way that’s considered inappropriate for certain public settings. Kids don’t know any better, but as the parents it’s YOUR JOB TO TEACH THEM. And if you don’t like it when other people do it, maybe that’s a sign to try doing it yourself. \n\nAnd believe it or not, I get it. Parenthood is INCREDIBLY stressful and requires a lot from you. But you can’t just do nothing because you’re too stressed and overwhelmed to parent. That’s not fair to everyone around you and it’s especially not fair to your kid. Respectfully, when you become a parent, you don’t have the privilege of solely thinking about yourself anymore. And no matter how much you want it to be, the total strangers around you aren’t to blame.

All of this because parents refuse to take responsibility for supervising their own children online.\n\nAnyone who cares about privacy should be vehemently opposed to this. Corporations already harvest massive amounts of personal data to build digital profiles, enable dynamic pricing, influence behavior, and monetize users in ways most people barely understand. Now we’re being told that to access basic online spaces, adults must hand over biometric data and official identification!!!!!\n\nThe justification doesn’t even hold up. Children will still find ways around these systems. They always do. They borrow IDs, create workarounds, move to less regulated platforms. Meanwhile, adults are left surrendering their privacy and autonomy just to exist online. At what point do adults get to have spaces on the internet without being treated like potential criminals?\n\n If Discord is acquired, shuts down, or restructures, what happens to that data? IDs and facial recognition information don’t disappear. They get transferred, sold, or absorbed into new corporate ecosystems, often with users forced to accept updated terms after the fact. That should terrify people.\n\nAll of this shifts responsibility away from where it actually belongs. Parents have tools: device controls, account restrictions, education, supervision. Teaching children about online safety is part of parenting. Instead, we’re allowing corporations to strip privacy from everyone because enforcing parental responsibility is inconvenient.\n\nThis trend won’t stop with Discord. Other platforms will follow, citing the same rationale: “protecting children from predators.” The result will be a more surveilled, less private internet for everyone, while the underlying problems remain unsolved.\n\nThis should be the breaking point. People should be angry. We should be pushing back HARD against both corporate overreach and the cultural refusal to hold parents accountable.

There will be one more to follow once I put the last of it to rest! It wasn’t supposed to drag out.\n\nHi 👋🏻 first time posting in this subreddit. There’s a long weekend coming up here in NZ. It’s summer (supposedly, tell that to our weather this year) and my husband and I are finally taking out our caravan! We had previously made plans to have our couple friends join us with just their big tent, they asked if it’s ok to bring their kids (ages 12, 7 and 4). We generally only catch up when they have a sitter but we thought “what’s the harm? It’s camping!” \n\nA last minute idea the other night our friends said they had excess bbq food and could them and their kids pop by for a quick catch up and that way we can meet the kids properly before camping. We thought it a great idea.\n\nOh. My. Goodness.\nThey were soooo bad! We ended up with felt pen all over our new sofa, they wrestled each other in our lounge and marked up our white walls and even though I gave them a plastic cup to drink from they somehow snuck a glass and broke it outside. All of this was after our friends telling their kids to stay outside… they kept getting in and running a muck. This included jumping on all of the beds and messing them up. The worst kids I’ve experienced. Our friends said the kids were more well behaved than normal (WHAT) and apologised about our sofa and offered to pay if there were stains.\n\nTo ice this messy cake, my friend announced another pregnancy. All of us are drinkers so we can’t even drink away the stress as it upsets my friend who now can’t drink. \n\nDo we just be honest that we want to cancel them coming with us? Imagine if it rains! Our beautiful caravan will be ruined, it may be anyway as the kids have no manners and are hell bent on doing what they aren’t allowed. I know my angry now pregnant friend will take major offence.

G said that now, when other friends share their news with her about becoming pregnant, it makes her extremely upset and jealous. And while she claims to be happy for them, she also expects them to tiptoe around her and gently let her know via text instead of in person so she has time to process and cry about not having a baby herself, before giving her congratulations. A little selfish but okay. \n\nHowever, she has not once communicated this expectation to anyone. So naturally, she’s losing friends because of it. A friend of G’s who was also trying to get pregnant was at G’s house recently and left a pregnancy test wrapper in her bathroom. No test showing any result, just a test wrapper. G was LIVID, saying how DARE she do that?! And I’m over here thinking… really? You’re mad at your friend who is wanting the exact same thing as you, simply because she also wants it and left some evidence of it in your house? G came to find out shortly after that the test was positive, and when G found that out she was even more upset that she wasn’t told right away (because of jealousy, IMO, but also, you didn’t want to know??), and they went from being super close to not speaking to each other. \n\nIt’s just wild to me how going through the trials of IVF has made her literally LESS empathetic to other people going through very similar things. G explained how she feels two things whenever another friend announces their pregnancy: joy for them, but also grief for herself. Valid. She has had a miscarriage so grief is very reasonable. I tried to empathize and relate to that and told G how I feel those two things also, but my grief is for the loss of friendship I’m about to experience because of the baby. I expressed how, as a child free person, I’ve had countless friendships that have been severely negatively impacted or stunted or broken because of the arrival of children, and the subsequent devaluing of the parents’ friendships and how that’s been really hard for me to navigate too. Did G respond to that? Nope. Barely even heard me. Just continued to talk about herself and expose how deeply immature and self-centered she is.\n\nTLDR: IVF journeys make people go crazy and they become so self-absorbed that they lose their empathy for others and are insanely jealous of those who have success.

Pregnancy disgusts me. You have something growing inside you, taking all your vitamins/minerals, and you have a huge stomach that basically debilitates you.\n\n2. The whole other part of pregnancy: the swelling, the nausea, the back pain, the boob pain, your brain shrinks during pregnancy (finding this out was my last straw), etc.\n\n3. YOU CAN DIE FROM PREGNANCY/CHILDBIRTH‼️\n\n4. I don't ever want to be tied to a man that much.\n\n5. It pisses me off that men just get to have children and women have to work for it, so just for the principle of it: no.\n\n6. Women do most of the childcare and housework.\n\n7. The havoc pregnancy brings to your body after: loose skin, inability to hold your bladder, saggy boobs, weight gain, hormone changes, your feet can grow and never go back (imagine having to replace all your shoes), teeth can fall out, hair falls out, your pelvic muscles are cooked, the list goes on and on.\n\n8. Piggybacking onto the weight gain/body changes: I had an ED for 8 years, so I would be scared of a relapse. EDs can also be passed down through genes, so I wouldn't want that for my child.\n\n9. I'm scared I would overfeed or underfeed them since my relationship with food is, to say the least, bad and worse, pass it down to my children. I don't want them to suffer through weight problems, whether that be them being over- or underweight.\n\n10. I don't want to pass down my body image issues to them.\n\n11. I cuss like a sailor, which is a no-go around children.\n\n12. I've had pretty bad insomnia my whole life and couldn't take my sleeping meds while pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n13. I also love not sleeping till late and then sleeping in when I'm not dealing with my insomnia. Having to wake up at the ass crack of dawn is my worst nightmare.\n\n14. I despise screaming and love quiet.\n\n15. I'm autistic, so I can't imagine being overstimulated at work and having a child going, “MommMMmm, what's for dinner?” at home.\n\n16. The never-ending touch. This would drive my autistic ass insane.\n\n17. The world is a horrible place right now; I don't want to bring a child into this.\n\n18. The responsibility.\n\n19. I do not want to cook EVERY. SINGLE. DAMN. DAY.\n\n20. I do not want to share food with a child. Imagine having your own ice cream and a crotch goblin screaming that it wants it too.\n\n21. I want to travel the world and focus on my career.\n\n22. I do not want to be reduced to just being a mom and an incubator. This happens so often to women, suddenly their hobbies, interests, wants, and needs don't matter. Just look at the presents people give moms on their birthdays or holidays (spoiler: it’s usually gifts for the baby).\n\n23. Less time for my own hobbies.\n\n24. Children are expensive asf.\n\n25. They can come out disabled or sick. I just don’t want to deal with that, as awful as it sounds.\n\n26. Now let's imagine a scenario: you have to go to the store. You now have to take: a bottle, a pacifier, diaper bag, diapers, a whole stroller, wipes, snacks, bibs, the child (😔). The list is endless. I would never get anywhere.\n\n27. Imagine your child having a tantrum in public. I would die of embarrassment.\n\n28. I do not want to listen  to mf “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” or “Baby Shark” all day. I’d much rather listen to rap or jazz on full blast.\n\n29. I do not want to watch Paw Patrol or whatever tf kids watch now. I'm a true crime junky, and that’s way too gory for children.\n\n30. I can go anywhere or anytime I want and don't have to worry about who is going to take care of my pet sperm.\n\n31. Kids vomit, pee, and poop all the time. Imagine cleaning that shit up (literally).\n\n32. I love baking and painting. Guess who else does? Yeah, I don't want any grubby, musky, sticky fingers anywhere near that stuff.\n\n33. I would have to childproof everything.\n\n34. I would have to talk to more people: parents, teachers, doctors (if you can't tell, I'm an introvert).\n\n35. Imagine sitting through a parent-teacher meeting. Omfg, I would die of boredom.\n\n36. Kids get sick all the time. Imagine catching every single sickness all the way from kindergarten to high school.\n\n37. Teens create so much drama and are very moody.\n\n38. I LOVE hour-long, steaming hot showers. My guilty pleasure. Not really possible with an uncooked adult.\n\n39. Figuring out how you should discipline your child.\n\n40. Getting questioned for said parenting decisions.\n\n41. I'm scared I would birth a boy, try to raise him well, and he would fall for the red-pill conservative pipeline, or worse, rape or kill someone.\n\n42. Organizing my day around school. I have done that enough.\n\n43. Helping said children with homework. Don't ask me about math or chem, idk either bro.\n\n44. Carrying a child around. That shit is heavy.\n\n45. I like to sleep half-naked.\n\n46. I hate cleaning, and crotch goblins make a lot of messes.\n\n47. I love my cat to bits and pieces. If the child came out allergic to it, it would have to be the one to go. I'm sorry 💔💔.\n\n48. You have to watch out for pedos so much in this day and age.

Fuck.\n\nAnd the worst part, she ended up getting engaged with the guy that was pressuring her the most on having kids and a family, and when she agreed she said that kids are still a MAYBE and she would consider them in the future where he replied \"\"I WILL STILL TRY TO SWAY YOU TO THE OTHER DIRECTION AND CONVINCE YOU HEHE\"\"\" fucking lunatic.\n\nEmma is 27, my age, why the fuck would anyone think that a 27 year old woman needs persuasion regarding ANY life decision ?? I personally have some mental health issues which is also a big part of why I don't want kids. How can you hear a woman saying she is scared for her future child to have a deadly disease and say OH WELL YOU SHOULD STILL DO IT THOUGH, MAYBE THE KID WILL BE FINE - MAYBE.\n\nThis is the \"IT WON'T HAPPEN TO ME\" mentality that I hate most in this world, yeah, everyone's child can be disabled, everyone's wife can die at birth, everything bad can happen to anyone just NOT to them. Even if I truly wanted kids I would never allow myself to bring a child into this fucked up world and put them in a position where they could suffer a fate similar or, God forbid, worse than mine - the mere thought makes me sick to my stomach -  but hey, it won't happen to their kids, right ?\n\nMy disdain for men grows day by day more and more.

There were a bunch of perks like a deeply discounted cafeteria on campus (think <$5 for a large lunch), lots of PTO, good healthcare, discounts, a nice free gym, and locker room all on campus plus free catered meals when work ramped up (And the salary was pretty high). As a single CF professional in a big city at the time this was the dream job.\n\nOne of my coworkers was married with 2 kids plus a man-baby husband who \"didn't like being left alone with the kids\".  🙄 As in, he was adamant about them having kids from the get go but didn't want to have to watch them by himself at any time. Like clockwork, every time the hours ramped up for busy season her phone would ring constantly because he would call to complain about her being at work late and he hated having to watch the kids.\n\nThis was a normal and predictable uptick in hours but somehow he was caught off guard each time. When her phone rang I'd hear her walk away from her desk and quietly try to console him about how she'd be home as soon as she could, remind him of where she set things up for him at home for the kids, and apologize PROFUSELY that he had to watch his own kids. It was mind boggling to me that she had to do that. It sounded like he really wanted a SAHM but also didn't want to give up the 2nd income.\n\nI was coming to the realization at the time that I was actually CF and that pushed me HARD in that direction. Work was already stressful. Heck, LIFE can already be stressful so why add on top of that complete nonsense like that?! I also refused to date at the time because I was too career focused to risk the drama of someone complaining that I had to be at work. (Later on I met my wonderful husband who is an amazing partner and not a man-baby)\n\nBonus story - I also had a hair stylist who divorced her husband over similar nonsense. She was in the hospital with pregnancy complications for HIS baby and he showed up to the hospital to complain about how he had to feed the kids. She realized that she was better off on her own for many reasons including this straw that broke the camels back.

I don’t think I will ever be able to bring myself to get on the apps tbh I’ve always joked that “he’ll have to find me on my couch” which is actually not too far off because I’m either there or at the dog park.\n\nI guess this is a rant, because I will never understand why people want children. It’s immediately uncomfortable (and a turnoff) to me that someone is looking at me as a prospective incubator/laborer. \n\nAnyway, F’s in the chat for me🫰🏻🫰🏻 and stay warm & safe this weekend if you’re in the Eastern US!

That it contains extremely mature content and VERY heavy themes that people under a certain age do not yet have the self-awareness and/or nuance to properly grasp and understand. Instead of having an appropriate and PRIVATE discussion about such things with their children, parents instead don’t give a shit about how their kids will respond to being exposed to those mature themes. They take on the attitude of “Oh, we’re such cool parents for letting our kids watch adult stuff!! Our kids are so mature for their age! In fact, they’re so mature that it’s totally fine if they go into adult spaces and talk to the adult fans of this adult show!!” \n\nIf a parent is truly intent on letting their kid watch a show like Hazbin, whatever. They’re the parent, it’s solely up to them, blah blah blah. \n\nBut knowingly bringing their children into strictly adult-only spaces and expecting everyone to treat them as adults?? Or expecting everyone in the adult space to completely censor themselves and not talk about adult things because there’s ONE child among them? \n\nI shouldn’t be surprised by the sheer irrationality and total absence of judgement of parents nowadays and yet here I am.

How are you going to plan for your estate?\n\nEDIT:  I’m sorry if this is tone deaf.  I know so many are struggling with this economy.  Just trying to do some estate planning.\n\nIt is amazing how many people plan to leave their estate to charities for animals.  ♥️ And, you gave me lots of food for thought for other organizations that I hadn’t thought about to help people who are invisible and struggling from systematic oppression.  I was especially touched by helping the elderly who don’t have the safety net that we are so privileged to have.

Again, I shut my brain off, so I might have misunderstood.\n\nToday at lunch she sat next to me again and talked about her son again—fortunately nothing as disgusting as last time. I’ve realized that the only personality she has is being a mother and nothing more. Sad for her.\n\nThanks to everyone for your messages.", "author": "nanika187", "score": 271, "num_comments": 88, "created_utc": 1770140187.0, "permalink": "/r/childfree/comments/1quygfq/why/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1quygfq/why/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.6624951362609863, "compound_score": -0.6477, "scores": {"negative": 0.6625, "neutral": 0.3227, "positive": 0.0148}}}, {"post": {"id": "1qjh58h", "subreddit": "childfree", "title": "fun fact: babies have evolved to have a louder and more annoying cry", "selftext": "not only that, but they cry at a frequency that is specifically louder to our ears, adult human ears. \n\njust thought about that because my mom was watching a show in the other room that had a baby crying in it 🙄 god i hate that noise\n\nanyway just thought i'd leave this here and see what you guys thought about it", "author": "dumbass_777", "score": 267, "num_comments": 53, "created_utc": 1769046132.0, "permalink": "/r/childfree/comments/1qjh58h/fun_fact_babies_have_evolved_to_have_a_louder_and/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1qjh58h/fun_fact_babies_have_evolved_to_have_a_louder_and/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.8105376958847046, "compound_score": -0.7904, "scores": {"negative": 0.8105, "neutral": 0.1693, "positive": 0.0202}}}], "comments": [{"comment": {"id": "o4vchz4", "post_id": "1r293yy", "subreddit": "childfree", "body": "Yay.

Since I was young and still learning about childfreedom, I didn't know how to properly screen my dates. However, at the beginning of our relationship, I made it clear I did not want children. He appeared to be on the same page, and he would often remark about how difficult it was growing up as one of six children in a single income home. \n\n\n\nAbout a month before I graduated college, he started to act really insecure. Then one night the truth came out; he was expecting me to give up on pursuing my career after I graduated, and he wanted no fewer than four kids. FOUR KIDS?! I pointed out all the times he remarked about the struggles of growing up poor and in a large family, but that fell on deaf ears. Coming from a traditional Mexican family, his worth was wrapped up in making a woman submit to his will for the sake of his fragile, masculine ego. We didn't speak for a week and then mutually decided to break up. \n\n\n\nWithin a month of our break up, he was already in a new, long distance relationship with a woman from two states over. She eventually moved to our state to cohabitate with him, and I ended up learning through the grapevine that he was physically abusing her. In fear for her life, she silently escaped one day and moved back to her home state. \n\n\n\nFollowing her departure, his friends began calling me, asking if he ever physically harmed me. Luckily, he didn't, but I think that's on account of me being a boxer and knowing how to physically defend myself. Additionally, he started trying to reconnect and, of course, attempted to play the \"my ex is crazy\" card to absolve himself of any wrongdoing. I didn't take the bait and simply asked for him and his friends to stop contacting me because I wasn't party to this relationship. \n\n\n\nThis happened 16 years ago, and to this day, he's still not married, has no kids, he still lives at home with his mother, and none of his relationships since then have lasted more than a year. I've since switched careers, but we used to work in the same industry. Some of my former co-workers are still friends with him, and they've told me that, whenever my name comes up at get-togethers, all his friends and family express how much they miss me and think he fucked up by letting me go. I, however, am so thankful I dodged that massive bullet. ", "author": "CultOfMourning", "score": 258, "created_utc": 1771016475.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.5702366232872009, "compound_score": -0.3622, "scores": {"negative": 0.396, "neutral": 0.5702, "positive": 0.0338}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o57nrf3", "post_id": "1r3urv6", "subreddit": "childfree", "body": "Not my story but I know someone with a similar situation where the man left to marry a woman to have kids with and she ended up being infertile, now divorced he regretted his decision and wished he never left the love of his life to have kids.", "author": "aleis31", "score": 126, "created_utc": 1771009222.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.6396885514259338, "compound_score": -0.6241, "scores": {"negative": 0.6397, "neutral": 0.3448, "positive": 0.0155}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o57y4hv", "post_id": "1r3urv6", "subreddit": "childfree", "body": "I had always said I wanted \"one or less\"; he wanted two or three.

Here's another example that's close to home: I'm an EMT, and on the stretchers/cots you see in ambulances in addition to 3 main seatbelts for the legs/waist/torso there's usually 2 sets of shoulder straps. The reason all 5 need to be used barring certain circumstances) is that in a head on collision and/or a rollover the 3 main belts alone aren't enough to keep a patient flying into the seat behind the stretcher's head(which poses a danger if a provider is sitting their too), or from sliding out in a rollover. In fact when assessing patients in car accidents some of the questions we ask is:\n\n-How fast were they going?\n\n-Was there an internal collision?(head or chest hitting the steering wheel, etc)\n\n-Was the victim restrained/wearing a seat belt?\n\nDespite all this, it is SO. DAMN. COMMON for my fellow EMTs and paramedics to not use the shoulder straps. Reasons being is they see them as unnecessary overkill , claim they get in the way of vitals, placing an EKG, etc(they are adjustable just like the other belts), apathy/burnout or just ''nothing is gonna happen''. Even if someone else like me puts the shoulder straps on some people then deliberately remove them. A quick Google search shows not only have ambulance crashes happened but patients have died or been seriously injured from not being fully restrained. I've had coworkers tell me ''have you ever been in a crash''(I've come close, not through fault of my own)or ''it's not gonna happen.''  By that logic I shouldn't have a smoke detector when I rent my first apartment since no house I've lived in has caught on fire.\n\nBut I digress. Basically even professionals can fall victim to this line of thinking, so not surprising it's common with parents.\n\nEDIT: Here's an example of what I mean for those interested: \n\nhttps://www.ems1.com/legal/articles/driver-2-others-indicted-in-ga-ambulance-crash-that-killed-66-year-old-patient-FiBlNY3g6R2mcC02/\n\nI added in some other considerations for those curious. An unsecure patient in a crash besides being bad for the patient is also bad for any providers in the back as the patient becomes a projectile. Some circumstances do exist where shoulder straps might need to be avoided or only use one(CPR in progress where compressions need minimal interruptions or patients who have severe contractures which are when joints become severely stiffened or tight which limits positioning ability). Sometimes we often have to not be secured in a seatbelt ourselves for patient care, but I'm doing my best to make that more of a habit). And I was almost was t boned when I had the greenlight in a past job.

What her parents thought never really mattered, because her parents weren’t going to be the ones taking care of the babies. \n\nAll she could say was no one ever told her.\n\nThe funny thing about this is I think a lot of us on this sub are very independent thinkers and very logical. Most of us won’t pass those traits/ideas/skills down to children.\n\nSometimes I wonder if our brains are wired  to think more logically and to not have children. Not in a we are superior kind of way but our brains process ideas differently. \n\nIn my opinion, the discovery that I didn’t have to have children came easily despite the narrative people fed me. ", "author": "Substantial_Ant_4845", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1769602220.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.6271381974220276, "compound_score": -0.6032, "scores": {"negative": 0.6271, "neutral": 0.3489, "positive": 0.024}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4doe6h", "post_id": "1qzttu2", "subreddit": "childfree", "body": "If churches can have \"cry rooms\" for kids, planes can have children-friendly sections.", "author": "pastajewelry", "score": 791, "created_utc": 1770610977.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.654771089553833, "compound_score": -0.0805, "scores": {"negative": 0.2129, "neutral": 0.6548, "positive": 0.1324}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4dsqnf", "post_id": "1qzttu2", "subreddit": "childfree", "body": "Wait, churches have WHAT?

Finally, a dad appears and offers him a dried shred of mango or something. The kid is losing his little mind, and I'm still just eating my candy. \n\nA flight attendant appears and tells them the kid has to be in his seat belt, or we can't leave. The mom said, \"If *she* would just put the candy away, he'd be fine!\" as she jerked her head in my direction. \n\nThe flight attendant was over it already. \"She can eat her candy. Your kid's reaction is not her responsibility. Now, are we going to get belted in and have a good flight?\" \n\nThe parents get the kid belted in, but he's thrashing so hard the seat is hitting the person behind him and across from me. And the screaming! Bloody hell. \n\nSeat belt sign goes off, kid stands up in his seat and turns around, seeing me still eating my Swedish fish. The screams start again. The guy across from me asked if he could have some, and I said, sure!! So I passed some across the aisle. Of course, the kid is climbing and reaching and screaming, while my new buddy and I savor those delicious Swedish fish. \n\nMom and Dad were plugged into the movies, so they were ignoring their kid as he climbed over the seat and landed in the lap of the guy across from me, grabbing for the candy in his hand. \n\nI press the call button while Mom slowly gets up and makes a half-ass effort to pick up her kid, who is fully out of control at this point. The flight attendant arrives, the mom tells her it's my fault for having candy, and they'd like to be moved because I \"hate children and have no empathy, and I'm teasing her kid with candy on purpose.\"\n\nIt wasn't a terribly full flight. \n\nI know she thought they'd get moved up to premium economy, but NO!

Their life choices were marriage/motherhood, or prostitution/starvation.  This gave the impression that all women want babies, but logically you can't claim that.  You can only claim that women found motherhood preferable to starving on the streets.\n\nMen's livelihoods weren't tied to marriage/fatherhood, BUT they needed heirs to pass their property / wealth to.  So there was pressure for them to marry and reproduce as well.  This gave the impression that all men wanted to be fathers.  But all the rules for that have changed too.\n\nStatistically, there has always been a percentage of the population, men and women, who had no desire to have kids.  With the recent economic and social freedoms, those people can now choose to actually live childfree.\n\nSo when you say everyone wants babies, or that kids just happen eventually, you are allowing history that's no longer relevant to define the path of your life.  It's the biggest decision of your life, and you're not even making it for yourself.  You're letting a bunch of long-dead people bypass your choice and default you into something that will forever change everything about your life.\n\nThat history doesn't define me.

I wish I could remember where I saw it, but I remember seeing comments from physicians recommending cancer patients to do everything in their power to try to get care from a hospital like UCSF or some other well-renowned hospital because their outcomes are just plain better. It seems [research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7251445/) also supports this claim, at least for certain types of cancer and cancer treatment.

If financially possible, something to consider is hiring a live-in nanny. It sounds like you could genuinely burn out FAST. Perhaps a better way for you to help, again if it’s at all possible, is to gather *additional support*. \n\nYou said your family is small, but is your community? \n\nI’m going to throw some ideas to you. You check them out when you’re ready:\n\nYou might be able to find parents willing to have weekly or biweekly play dates where they cover for y’all for a couple of hours after school (paid or unpaid). You all may be able to have the school host a spaghetti dinner to fundraise costs for more in-home care or the cost of daycare. You may be able to do a go-fund-me. There may also be community events where you can take the kids, but they are super occupied (story time at the library, local swim classes or town pool, trips to the park, ask your local town office and local libraries what’s out there. You never know what you might find. Many communities will really come together for a family, especially when cancer is involved. \n\nI’m sure everything feels extremely overwhelming right now. But consider reaching out to others as a lifeline. You all need a bigger support system. Start small. If you have the kids this next week, take them to the library (a children’s library would be even better). While they listen to a story, talk with the librarian and dig into some potential resources together. Librarians are notoriously helpful and literally trained for research. They are there to provide a (wonderful) service to the community. Lean on them. Bonus: reading together is the top activity families can do with the kids to prepare them for  higher academics.  To get kids reading, read to and with them. \n\nReading is also a calming activity to do together to help regulate emotions and be quiet.  I’m guessing their noise is one of the overwhelming parts for you (it is for me!). So doing something inherently quiet is a huge plus. I would also recommend coloring. Anything for now to encourage quiet behaviors while inside. They can be loud and boisterous *outside*. And while they are outside, you can use noise canceling earbuds to block out the higher pitched noises without ignoring them. \n\nI know I just dove into a LOT of details. It’s likely everything feels overwhelming right now. I hope you can also carve out some time in the near future to decompress and process all of this. \n\nWhat’s happening to you is not fair. I think it’s wonderful that you are there to provide some major support to your family. But this situation still isn’t fair: to you, your sister, her children, her partner, your mom. It sucks all around and it’s totally normal to feel your feelings about it all. Like you said, your whole life just massively changed. It’ll take time to adjust and form a routine. Like you kind of touched on, change is freaking *hard* to deal with. The sooner you can establish some sort of routine, the more regulated you *and* the kids will be and the more it hopefully won’t feel like change. It doesn’t make it suck less. But if you can trick your brain into thinking “yup, this is normal. This is just what we do”, it might be an easier transition for you. \n\nAnd finally remember that things don’t have to go perfectly. Keep ‘em fed, keep ‘em safe, and keep ‘em relatively clean; for now that’s it for right now. You’ve got time to iron out the details. Just work on slowly building up some extra support.\n\n**If someone hasn’t already (sister’s partner may have), call the 10 year old’s school on Monday to let them know what’s going on and see what supports they can offer. Ask about a fundraiser! That’s one small step where I would start. \n\nUgh good luck. Vent any time you need to. This does suck!

I too am a parentified keeper of my whole family, with parents with a history of personality disorders leading to my diagnosis of CPTSD, with serious endometriosis and adenomyosis leading to chronic pain for 15 years, and a history of abuse in therapy. So, I think your upset is completely valid and I also get staying with someone who treats your trauma. Do think about whether you are more willing to stay with her because of your past abuse. I used to tolerate a lot more because it was less bad than what ai was used to \n\nI also get not wanting kids young. I didn't either. I didn't have safe parents as a role model and my childhood was full of anxiety. I want you to know that when you get out on your own and build a life separate from your parents, you life and who you get to be changes a lot. I'm CF because I am finally living a peaceful and happy life after raising my parents and siblings.\n\nI also acknowledge that if my endometriosis has been successfully treated sooner, I may have been able to pursue treatment of my CPTSD sooner, and in my few years of therapy, I am a much different person than I used to be. I'm pretty baked into who I am now in my 40s, but had I gotten the help I needed earlier, maybe I would have decided to be a parent. I don't hate kids, I'm just late in figuring out who I am and finally happy after so many decades. I know that I do not want to be an elder parent, and I am 100% okay with the choice I made, but if this was me at 25 I might have decided kids were part of my future. (I still am grossed out by the concept of sex for the purposes of getting pregnant.)\n\nYour therapist is wrong for how she handled the situation, and, she probably sees being CF as part of your trauma she is trying to heal. I do not think you should change your mind about being CF or getting sterilized. I am only sharing my context for being CF as a result of my trauma since it is so similar to your own.

For that reason alone, he has emotionally withdrawn—love, compassion, even intimacy have slowly disappeared.\n\nFrom my perspective, this is what women actually get from pregnancy and motherhood.\n\nFirst, childbirth itself.\nWomen go through a massive physical and psychological transformation. Hormones fluctuate intensely—this is medically proven—and that impacts mood, mental health, and emotional regulation. Then comes labour pain, postpartum healing, sleep deprivation from breastfeeding and night care, and the slow erasure of self-care. Weight gain, hair loss, skin issues, chronic fatigue—these are not rare side effects; they’re common.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning.\n\nNext comes toddlerhood.\nA phase filled with tantrums, boundary-testing, emotional manipulation (developmentally normal, but exhausting), and constant dependency. Many women are forced—directly or indirectly—to step back from their careers because the mental and physical load becomes too much.\n\nThen comes adolescence.\nYour child begins to differentiate from you, defy you, push against you. You worry constantly. You negotiate, appease, compromise. By now, most women have lost a strong sense of personal identity. Their happiness is deeply tied to their child’s emotional state. You are no longer seen as an individual—you are a mother first, always.\n\nThen comes puberty.\nNo explanation needed.\n\nAnd finally, when things start to settle—you are older. Tired. Often invisible. And in many cases, if the child was born later in life, you may not even live long enough to see them fully independent.\n\nThat, in reality, is what a woman gets from pregnancy and childbirth.", "author": "Atreyee_C", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1769999074.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.532196581363678, "compound_score": -0.4092, "scores": {"negative": 0.4385, "neutral": 0.5322, "positive": 0.0293}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o319z5s", "post_id": "1qt4c17", "subreddit": "childfree", "body": "To be fair, the first point is basically all you need.

And sexual dimorphism is also heavily influenced by nutrition. Hunter gatherer male and female people didn't differ hugely in size and there's good evidence that women hunted alongside men. This was, roughly, how we lived for a few hundred thousand years. Everything went sideways for women around 12,000 years ago when we discovered farming. Suddenly women could become pregnant all the time and died regularly from it (in part due to larger babies thanks to nutrition) and men started fighting wars over territory to give to their children. Then we figured out how to mostly keep women alive and the babies too so you had population booms where women were surviving having huge numbers of children. This caused widespread misery, illness and poverty and contraception has gone a long way to fix that. Overall we're reckoning with a lot of those big changes now and returning to a more equal society where women are able to have fewer kids and work alongside men (yes there is currently a backlash but it's only a few steps back).

It's always felt kind of lame to me because it feels totally out of character for some of them and also completely interrupts the plot as a whole. And it still annoys me, and now I'm 23 years old. I never ended up finishing the final book in that series because of how boring it became to me lol.", "author": "Friend_of_a_Cat", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1769802694.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.5993685126304626, "compound_score": 0.1257, "scores": {"negative": 0.1375, "neutral": 0.5994, "positive": 0.2632}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2mzn8s", "post_id": "1qr9snc", "subreddit": "childfree", "body": "Yep, similar thing happened with the Lexi graves books I used to read on kindle unlimited", "author": "commentspanda", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1769794074.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8815996050834656, "compound_score": 0.0019, "scores": {"negative": 0.0583, "neutral": 0.8816, "positive": 0.0601}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2nhm6x", "post_id": "1qr9snc", "subreddit": "childfree", "body": "This is why I really enjoy a lot of the books from Stephen King.

Just because it’s not my wish doesn’t mean that I don’t understand how it is others. I usually am okay just skipping over it. But to reduce a woman to her womb pisses me off everytime.\n\nThis woman was a kick ass supernatural detective. The prophecy behind her seemed to be regarding her and how she would do something great…and it’s to be a baby maker. How is that even- grrr! 😡 I have never noped out of a series so fast. I have been angry at books before but I am absolutely furious. I feel like this author did not only the character a disservice but a disservice to every woman who decides she doesn’t want a kid. She made it so that this woman (who again was amazing) was important solely for popping out a crotch goblin. \n\nMaybe it’s projection on my part and I am irrationally angry about this, but it feels like she just set women back two centuries. The thing is the character didn’t even seem to want a kid either, but that too was disregarded because this author thought ‘the importance of a woman is her womb.
