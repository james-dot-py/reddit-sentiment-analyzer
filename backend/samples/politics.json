Thomas Massie is threatening to invoke what he has called a “nuclear option” to force transparency from President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice.\n\n>Massie (R-Ky.), who has pushed harder than any other Republican for the release of the files pertaining to the late sex criminal and his circle of powerful friends, will join Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to view unredacted versions of the DOJ files on Monday.\n\n>Under a law introduced by Massie and Khanna last year, which Congress passed almost unanimously, the DOJ was required to release all files to the public in December without redacting information solely to protect public figures from embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\n\n>But millions still remain under lock and key, while those made public, including a tranche of more than 3 million released late last month, are heavily redacted.\n\n>Those files contained many references to Trump as well as other powerful figures, including former President Bill Clinton, tech billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Gates, and former British ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson.  \n...  \nIn a Sunday appearance on CNN‘s “Inside Politics,” Massie accused the Trump administration of violating the law by failing to meet the deadline for the public release of information and by releasing the names of victims while covering up the names of alleged perpetrators.\n\n>He said that of particular interest were the FBI’s 302 files, which contain information from official interviews with witnesses and victims of Epstein’s abuse, which he said the DOJ is still withholding.\n\n>He also said the DOJ was “overredacting” documents related to “some really sketchy emails” between Epstein and associates, on which “we can’t see who the sender was.”\n\n>Massie said that Attorney General Pam Bondi “will be in front of my committee,” referring to the House Judiciary Committee, on Wednesday to answer questions about the release of the files.\n\n>He said he plans to ask her why the rest of the documents have not been released, why—even with the delays that purportedly gave officials time to ensure victims’ identifying information was redacted—they still published the names of some victims, and what information has been redacted from the files.\n\n>Asked by anchor Manu Raju how he would respond if the DOJ continued to flout the law, Massie said he was prepared to begin reading off the names of Epstein’s clients on the House floor, provided the victims “believe that the best way to get justice is to force the DOJ to release these names.”\n\n>Massie also remarked on the revelation in the latest batch of files that Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, who’d claimed to have cut ties with Epstein back in 2005, had actually continued a business and personal relationship with him years after he’d been convicted of sex crimes in 2008. This included joint business ventures, dinner gatherings, and a planned trip to Epstein’s infamous private island in 2012.\n\n>Asked whether Lutnick should testify before the Judiciary Committee, Massie instead said, “No, he should just resign.”  \n...  \nIn a post to social media Sunday, Massie called on inquisitive followers to point out which concerning documents they want him to scrutinize, saying those that receive the most “likes” will be his first priority.\n\n>Among the documents that have garnered the most outrage and demands for transparency are:\n\n>* A 2014 email in which a person, whose name has been redacted, thanked Epstein “for a fun night” and told him “your littlest girl was a little naughty”;\n* Another 2014 email in which a person, whose name has been redacted, said they were giving Epstein “permission to kill” an unspecified person;\n* A 2009 email in which a person, whose name has been redacted, told Epstein they “loved the torture video”;\n* And a heavily redacted federal prosecution memo, sent after Epstein’s death in 2019 to then-US Attorney Geoffrey Berman, which discusses investigative steps and possible liability of Epstein’s associates, and several uninvestigated claims relating to complicity and participation in his crimes.

Both sides went into it with their own objectives and strategies.\n\nBondi had 3 objectives:  don’t implicate any of the men she is trying to protect, don’t implicate the DoJ in a coverup, and don’t get caught in a perjury.\n\nHer strategy was simple and not at all novel.  Do not confirm or deny anything.  Use vague answers or safe statements that can’t be easily disproven instead of answering anything definitively.  Deflect, pivot, and attack the character and intentions of the questioners to undermine the substance of their questions.  The performative righteous outrage wasn’t a meltdown.  It was one of her very limited tools to try to survive that gauntlet of hardball questioning.  The GOP did it’s best to help her out with Jordan’s obvious bias in enforcing the rules on full display, but there was only so much they could do to buffer her and she had to maintain her act and try to avoid any traps for 5 grueling hours.  You can see the exhaustion on her face deep into the meeting compared to the beginning.\n\nThe democrats had 3 objectives as well: highlight the DoJ’s loss of credibility under Bondi’s leadership, raise public awareness of all of the ties between the people in Trump’s orbit and Jeffry Epstein, and try to get Bondi to perjure herself.\n\nThey knew exactly what Bondi’s objectives were and how she would attempt to achieve them and strategized accordingly.  Raskin laid out the plan in his opening statement by preemptively enumerating the tactics Bondi would rely on before she even answered the first question.  After that, the dems methodically grilled her with well prepared, clear questions following a template of presenting evidence discovered in the Epstein files such as correspondences between Epstein and various ranking members of Trump’s administration, followed by asking for a yes or no answer to the simple and clear question of had the DoJ investigated the mentioned person for ties to Epstein.  The insistence for yes/no answers was a key part of the strategy because they wanted everyone to see that Bondi was absolutely unwilling to give them those answers.  Raskin told everyone what to expect and the dems made it glaringly obvious as it was happening.  It was a brilliant strategy to expose Bondi’s gaslighting for what it was and each round of questions resulted in the exact same pattern of behavior from Bondi, making it impossible not to see.\n\nBut they also were trying to throw her off balance and trip her up with traps like the one Ted Lieu finally caught her in.  That was when she genuinely lost it.  Her screaming “Don’t you accuse ME of a crime!” came straight from the gut as she realized she’d failed the one objective with the most personal significance and likely ended her career.  \n\nBecause now the dems have ammunition to impeach her.  Perjury in no small deal.  And if she is tried for perjury, she won’t be able to give evasive non-answers to yes/no questions anymore.  Pleading the fifth during an interrogation isn’t incriminating, but doing it during a trial leaves the jurors with no choice but to assume that the answers you refuse to give are the ones that would damage your case.\n\nI doubt Trump will allow Bondi to be impeached.  He will likely manufacture a reason to be dissatisfied with her that has nothing to do with the hearing and fire her.  And then declare war on Cuba or something to try to rinse away the press coverage before anyone can think too hard about it.  Bondi could try to fabricate her own reason for resigning to try to save her dignity and future career prospects, but that might piss Trump off if he feels his image is weakened by not dictating the circumstances of her departure.\n\nWhatever happens, this was a big win for the dems because they opened a crack in the credibility of the DoJ in a very public setting.  It’s going to be a lot harder for FOX to sweep this under the rug with the actual clips of her perjury and performative histrionics echoing around on social media.  The Epstein files seem to be the one weak spot in Trump’s hold on MAGA, and if this crack in the narrative they’ve been ingesting from FOX and the FB Bot armies, it could be his undoing, especially as his support is already declining, and even if it isn’t, it will bring him closer to the edge.", "author": "GrumpyGiant", "score": 46, "created_utc": 1770933791.0}, {"id": "o50zlup", "post_id": "1r31glr", "subreddit": "politics", "body": "She was so cold hearted.", "author": "Imaginary-Ad-7919", "score": 106, "created_utc": 1770921862.0}, {"id": "o512g0b", "post_id": "1r31glr", "subreddit": "politics", "body": "Have you seen the dow though?", "author": "kgambito", "score": 29, "created_utc": 1770922648.0}, {"id": "o51ikw0", "post_id": "1r31glr", "subreddit": "politics", "body": "All by design.\n\nRoy Cohn 101.\n\n1.

There's a doctor and a worker at a reservoir in Georgia (the country) with the same obscure name. The doctor specialises in rheumatology and rehabilitation. They are likely unrelated.

The law violated and the requirements listed in the US code are explained by the prosecuting attorney. Most laymen who comprise the jury don’t have expertise in law so we have to take what we’re told at face value and try our best to understand it. Jurors only hear evidence from the witnesses called by the prosecution—usually someone like a responding officer, a detective or an inspector general. No counter arguments are given because the jury is only deciding if there’s enough evidence to indict, not guilt. It’s ridiculously easy for a prosecutor to get the outcome they want because of those factors. When a grand jury didn’t indict the officers in the Breonna Taylor case, I knew it was probably because the prosecutors did a piss poor job in presenting the evidence.  \n\nNow in this case, based on the political winds that are blowing, clearly there was a lack of evidence they violated any law.

Elissa Slotkin and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. The video, which outraged the Trump administration, had warned that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”\n\nThe declination is a rebuke of the administration’s efforts to paint the six lawmakers — all of whom served in either the military or intelligence services — as dangerously undermining the president’s authority as commander in chief. It was not immediately clear which of the lawmakers were facing indictments. CNN has asked the Justice Department for comment.\n\nAnd while the indictment was rejected by the grand jury, it is also an extraordinary escalation of the Justice Department’s willingness to prosecute who speak about against the president and his administration’s actions.\n\nThe video, posted in November, was met with immediate backlash from the Trump administration, including from the president himself who accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH.”\n\nWithin weeks, Slotkin and Kelly, along with Reps.

I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is.\"\n\nJournalist Michael Wolff had insider access to Trump and the White House and claims that Trump once considered a pardon for Maxwell because he was worried that she might \"spill secrets.\"\n\nAdditionally, according to flight logs released during Ghislaine Maxwell's trial, Trump has flown on the \"Lolita Express\" at least seven times.\n\nMassive conflict of interest aside, Todd Blanche (that former personal lawyer and now deputy AG) was tasked with interviewing Maxwell as part of the justice department's cover Trump's ass initiative. The meetings took place over the course of two days at the US attorney's office in Tallahassee, FL. This is known...\n\nIt should be noted that it is highly unusual for the second highest ranking DOJ official to meet personally with a criminal convicted of conspiracy and sex trafficking of minors. \n\nThe DOJ offered her *proffer immunity;* allowing her to speak openly without fear of her statements being used against her in the future.\n\nKeep in mind that this type of immunity is usually followed by some kind of cooperation deal.\n\nThe stated goal of the meetings was to gather information about any remaining leads and uncover any new information related to Epstein's crimes.\n\nThis whole effort conflicted with Trump's claims of being the most \"transparent\" president in history, as well as earlier statements from the Trump administration indicating that the Epstein case was closed.\n\nConsidering the timing, the optics, the lack of transparency, the limited immunity, etc, the real goal of these meetings went beyond merely \"information gathering.\"\n\nI don't believe it's even speculation at this point to suggest that this was an effort to negotiate for Maxwell's cooperation and control what information she might \"spill\" to the public. \n\nThe fact that there was initially so much secrecy around this; that the DOJ is essentially no longer independent and operates as Trump's personal legal arm; that Maxwell's statements aligned with what Trump and his allies were saying at the time; that the Trump administration's actions contradicted its public statements; and of course the fact that Trump once considered and may still be considering a pardon or some other act of clemency for Maxwell—all of these things should have raised deafening alarms for Americans.\n\nIt's clearly evident at this point that the current administration engaged in a massive cover up for Trump while trying to obscure his close, criminal ties to both Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nThat said, the White House still maintains the narrative that Trump kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago out of a sense of altruism and sympathy for the victims.\n\nBut It's already been revealed by Trump himself that their supposed falling out was centered around Epstein \"poaching\" his staff. Trump indicated that he was more concerned about losing these young girls than the fact that they were being trafficked and abused by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at the time.\n\nTrump conveniently waited till Epstein's arrest and death in 2019 to PUBLICLY state he was not a \"fan\" of him.\n\nThen there's the emails obtained by Democrats:\n\nEpstein to Ghislaine Maxwell:\n\n> “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump. [Victim] spent hours at my house with him … he has never once been mentioned.”\n\nMaxwell replied: “I have been thinking about that…”\n\nThis email was sent after Epstein was released from jail. After he pleaded guilty to soliciting underage sex.\n\nThese messages reveal that Trump knew about the abuse.\n\nTrump and Epstein had a very close, friendly and social relationship starting in the late 80s. They were both prominent figures in Palm Beach, Florida, where they were often seen together at social events and parties. Photos and videos show the two together at Mar-a-Lago, including clips of them laughing and ogling at young women. Evidence also shows that Trump and Epstein often made a game out of sharing their sexual exploits with each other.\n\nIn an interview in 2002, Trump said of Epstein:\n\n“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”\n\nRemember the infamous birthday letter?\n\n> \"Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.\"\n\nFox News deliberately edited Trump's response during an interview when he was asked if he would release the \"Epstein client list.\"\n\n> \"Yeah, I think we should release it. People deserve to know.\"\n\nFox left out his follow up:\n\n> \"But you have to understand, there’s a lot of lies in that list. A lot of names that shouldn’t be there. You don’t want to ruin innocent lives.\n\nIn 2005, police searched Epstein's Mansion and found message books containing Trump's name and number.\n\nVirginia Guiffre, one of Epstein's most vocal accusers, claimed that she was recruited into Epstein's sex trafficking ring while working at Mar-a-Lago. Giuffre sadly \"died by suicide\" last year.\n\nMaria Farmer, another reported Epstein victim, went to police twice back in the 90s to complain about Epstein's sexual abuse of girls. She brought up Trump's name because of his close ties to Epstein and after an encounter with Trump at Epstein's New York office:\n\n> Mr. Trump then arrived, wearing a business suit, and started to hover over her.\n\n> Ms. Farmer said she recalled feeling scared as Mr. Trump stared at her bare legs. Then Mr. Epstein entered the room, and she recalled him saying to Mr. Trump: “No, no. She’s not here for you.”\n\nOn his podcast, Michael Wolff stated that Epstein once showed him photographs of Trump at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion lounging around the pool with topless young girls—some of them sitting in Trump's lap.\n\nWolff described Trump and Epstein as \"joined at the hip\" for nearly 15 years. Both men have confirmed their close friendship together, this is NOT speculation. Hell, they even shared the same \"young women.\"", "author": "Choice-of-SteinsGate", "score": 148, "created_utc": 1770853689.0}, {"id": "o4xvhwi", "post_id": "1r2cxi8", "subreddit": "politics", "body": "to comment on one small bit: \"I guess they lived in Palm Beach\".

First of all, Dems and Independents would have to overwhelmingly win back the U.S. House and U.S. Senate this upcoming mid-term election (Tuesday, November 3, 2026). \n\nAnd while there is a good chance of winning back the U.S. House with a simple majority that is required to hold impeachment hearings and vote on articles of impeachment, winning enough U.S. Senate seats to actually CONVICT and remove from office a sitting President, would be a monumental hurdle to overcome. \n\nIn accordance to the U.S. Constitution, you need a 2/3 majority of U.S. Senators or 67 out of 100 to vote in favor of conviction and therefore removal of any elected official. The current U.S. Senate is made of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and 2 Independents who caucus with Democrats for a total of 47 seats. \n\nThere are 35 U.S. Senate seats up for election in this year's midterm election. 33 regular elections and 2 special elections with 22 Republican-held seats and 13 Democratic-held seats up for election. \n\nDems & Independents would have to win re-election in all 13 seats they currently hold and flip 20 seats that Republicans currently hold.
