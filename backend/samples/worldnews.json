One commentator, Bill Mann, noted the rejection, saying \"Canada calls the new bridge its biggest infrastructure priority and has even offered to pay for the span. But pesky U.S. special-interest politics intrude once again,\" as he reviewed a number of \"U.S. government actions (and inactions) that show little concern about Canadian concerns\".

The Canadian federal government would fund bridge construction, land acquisition in Michigan and the construction of Interstate 75 on-ramps. The Canadian contribution will be repaid from bridge tolls collected on the Canadian side, and no tolls will be charged on the U.S. side. The crossing agreement also included community benefits for residents on both sides of the Detroit River, including improvements to local neighbourhoods affected by bridge construction.

If we were to negotiate with the expansion of U.S. capacity from foreign manufactures and in the need of their technology to do so, because we can't and haven't not positioned ourselves to do so with science and education then we are at best delusional. Chips manufacturing takes years to set up. The facilities takes years to plan and produce. It isn't not simple. \n\nIf Taiwanese companies want to be in the U.S. then we as a nation need stable foreign policy with assurances for their facilities to be able to run with security to the end and possibly past the due date of facility expiration as planned by the designers of that facility.
