I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity. This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.\n\nI know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.\n\nThank you for all that you do.  \nTim", "author": "hasanahmad", "score": 2011, "num_comments": 780, "created_utc": 1769570408.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qozwrk/apples_cook_calls_for_deescalation_after_latest/", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/apple-s-cook-calls-for-deescalation-after-latest-ice-shooting"}, {"id": "1r0ftz8", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Apple Unlikely to Drop ‘Liquid Glass’ Design With iOS 27, Report Says", "selftext": "", "author": "WPHero", "score": 1944, "num_comments": 772, "created_utc": 1770669546.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1r0ftz8/apple_unlikely_to_drop_liquid_glass_design_with/", "url": "https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-unlikely-to-drop-liquid-glass-design-with-ios-27-report-says/"}, {"id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "NASA changes its mind, will allow Artemis astronauts to take iPhones to the Moon: “We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world.”", "selftext": "", "author": "ControlCAD", "score": 1804, "num_comments": 141, "created_utc": 1770328899.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qwz4b9/nasa_changes_its_mind_will_allow_artemis/", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-will-finally-allow-astronauts-to-bring-their-iphones-to-space/"}, {"id": "1r24yhk", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Apple Releases iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3", "selftext": "", "author": "piesaresquarey", "score": 1739, "num_comments": 350, "created_utc": 1770833700.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1r24yhk/apple_releases_ios_263_and_ipados_263/", "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/apple-releases-ios-26-3-and-ipados-26-3/"}, {"id": "1qxhk8l", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "iPhone 18 Pro Max Rumored to Deliver Next-Level Battery Life", "selftext": "✨ Apple Intelligence summary: The iPhone 18 Pro Max is rumoured to have a 5,100 to 5,200 mAh battery.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told employees that he’s “deeply distraught” with the US’s current approach to immigration and will continue pressing the issue with lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve heard from some of you that don’t feel comfortable leaving your homes,” Cook said during an all-hands meeting with staff on Thursday. “No one should feel this way. No one.”\n\nThe CEO added that immigration is especially important to Apple, which has “team members across the US on some form of Visa.”\n\n“For as long as I can remember, we have been a smarter, wiser, more innovative company because we’ve attracted the best and brightest from all corners of the world,” he said. “I am going to continue to lobby lawmakers on this issue. You have my word on that.”\n\nThe remarks expanded on a memo that Cook released last week, when he said he was “heartbroken” by events in Minneapolis, where US immigration agents have killed two people in recent weeks.\n\n“This is a time for deescalation,” Cook said at the time. He also said he had discussed the matter with President Donald Trump.\n\n“Every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,” the CEO during Thursday’s meeting. “No matter where they come from.”\n\nAfter Cook’s initial memo was released, employees privately criticized Cook for his limited and late response to the shootings. The executive also responded to an employee who said during the meeting that they are concerned about being deported and separated from their daughter.\n\nCook said, “I love you if you’re on DACA,” referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that allows people who came to the US as a child to remain in the country on a work permit. He said that Apple has hundreds of DACA workers. “I will personally advocate for you,” he said. “I am a huge believer in the program.”\n\nDuring the meeting, Cook also discussed the company’s artificial intelligence efforts and teased upcoming devices running the new technology.", "author": "hasanahmad", "score": 1484, "num_comments": 474, "created_utc": 1770320520.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qwvbsq/cook_in_internal_memo_to_employees_hes_deeply/", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/apple-s-cook-vows-to-lobby-lawmakers-on-immigration-issue"}, {"id": "1qzwi4w", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "iOS 27 to Focus on Bug Fixes, Performance, and Design Tweaks", "selftext": "", "author": "tecialist", "score": 1463, "num_comments": 341, "created_utc": 1770617280.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qzwi4w/ios_27_to_focus_on_bug_fixes_performance_and/", "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ios-27-to-focus-on-bug-fixes-and-tweaks/"}, {"id": "1qha42g", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and search results", "selftext": "", "author": "RetroVisionnaire", "score": 1394, "num_comments": 279, "created_utc": 1768842739.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qha42g/apple_testing_new_app_store_design_that_blurs_the/", "url": "https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/"}, {"id": "1qphpzf", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Teardown Reveals AirTag 2 Is Full of Hidden Changes", "selftext": "", "author": "spearson0", "score": 1320, "num_comments": 132, "created_utc": 1769621098.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qphpzf/teardown_reveals_airtag_2_is_full_of_hidden/", "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/airtag-2-full-of-hidden-changes/"}, {"id": "1qqfy5f", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Apple buys Israeli start-up Q.AI for close to $2bn in race to build AI devices", "selftext": "", "author": "bdzz", "score": 1308, "num_comments": 363, "created_utc": 1769709711.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qqfy5f/apple_buys_israeli_startup_qai_for_close_to_2bn/", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/49f4e2e4-3a68-4842-be67-879409d06aa1"}, {"id": "1qraezd", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Apple ‘runs on Anthropic,’ says Mark Gurman", "selftext": "", "author": "spearson0", "score": 1281, "num_comments": 285, "created_utc": 1769790969.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qraezd/apple_runs_on_anthropic_says_mark_gurman/", "url": "https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/30/apple-runs-on-anthropic-says-mark-gurman/?extended-comments=1"}, {"id": "1r451os", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "FTC wants Apple News to promote more Fox News and Breitbart stories", "selftext": "", "author": "KingFML", "score": 1233, "num_comments": 321, "created_utc": 1771026371.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1r451os/ftc_wants_apple_news_to_promote_more_fox_news_and/", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-ftc-denies-being-speech-police-but-says-apple-news-is-too-liberal/"}, {"id": "1qj6tzd", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Apple Expected to Unveil Five All-New Products This Year", "selftext": ">1.

There is no option to hide all hidden advertisements. \n\nThat means that a software that Apple provides with their premium devices includes **functions** that **guide** users towards a **subscription**. They do not contain any functionality in the software that is used. \n\nI believe that it's important to let Apple know our opinion. Something like this can quickly escalate further. Imagine veiled Ads in Settings, Finder, Notes or Safari that push the user towards other subscriptions and decrease the usability of the tools.\n\n  \nLink to send Apple feedback: [https://www.apple.com/feedback/](https://www.apple.com/feedback/)\n\nDetails and screenshots can be found under the following link: [iWork 15](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1qyguq0/i_feel_like_people_are_downplaying_the_creator/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\nI work in IT support and know many people that are not tech affine, especially elder people. They are quickly overwhelmed by veiled advertisements like these. So they subscribe, sometimes even unknowingly to things they don't need and pay for it - monthly or weekly. I know that this update will cause many people to subscribe to something they don't need and/or to have problems with the software that was hitherto really good to use. \n\nAs a UX-designer I also know how malicious these buttons are. They **only** serve to guide people towards a company goal. They **decrease** the **usability** while increasing the feeling of missing something. Of course that itself is not a problem but I find it very concerning that something like this appears on software that is included with premium devices which have a price that should cover the cost of basic software.\n\n  \nNote that I'm not against Apple Creator Studio itself. I like that Apple provides improved software for their basic Apps, even if I preferred a one-time buy option. \n\nHowever it is my strong belief that they should only advertise in setup, the App Store and maybe in one place that does not interfere with the daily activity in an App.\n\nLooking forward on your opinions on the matter.", "author": "Groll111", "score": 452, "num_comments": 115, "created_utc": 1770498553.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qypi4o/newest_iwork_release_shows_a_paradigmshift_in/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1qypi4o/newest_iwork_release_shows_a_paradigmshift_in/"}, {"id": "1r060sk", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Apple Says These 7 U.S. States Plan to Offer iPhone Driver's Licenses", "selftext": "", "author": "Few_Baseball_3835", "score": 451, "num_comments": 236, "created_utc": 1770648259.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1r060sk/apple_says_these_7_us_states_plan_to_offer_iphone/", "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/iphone-drivers-license-future-states/"}, {"id": "1ql01tr", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Apple Cash Instant Transfer Fees Are Going Up Soon", "selftext": "", "author": "spearson0", "score": 454, "num_comments": 148, "created_utc": 1769195762.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1ql01tr/apple_cash_instant_transfer_fees_are_going_up_soon/", "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/apple-cash-instant-transfer-fee-increase/"}, {"id": "1qkl2ht", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "Bugs Apple Loves", "selftext": "", "author": "HeartyBeast", "score": 445, "num_comments": 141, "created_utc": 1769155622.0, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/1qkl2ht/bugs_apple_loves/", "url": "https://www.bugsappleloves.com/"}, {"id": "1qgb7dq", "subreddit": "apple", "title": "I made a fast, simple and privacy friendly alternative to MyFitnessPal (Major Updates)", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSince it’s the time of the year where many of us are thinking about picking up healthier habits, I thought I’d share some major updates to **FitBee**, a calorie and macronutrient tracker I've been building solo over the past year and a half.\n\nThe most rewarding part of this journey hasn't been the code, but hearing from users and having real-world impact. Someone recently reached out to let me know they’ve lost 30lbs using FitBee so far. They mentioned that because the app is fast and bloat-free, it was the first time they actually stuck with tracking. Hearing that is exactly why I started this project—to build a tool that gets out of your way so you can hit your goals.\n\n# 🚀 Major updates since last time\n\n* 💦 Water Tracking: You can set water goals and track them using the app or the interactive widget. I didn’t actually track my water before building this, but now that I do I’m pretty shocked at how often I don’t drink enough water.\n* 👟 Step Tracking: You can now set step goals and track them in the app.\n* ❤️ Apple Health import/export is free for everyone - I want FitBee to work well with other apps and I don’t want to “lock” people in - they should be able to take their data with them.\n* 🥘 Improved food database - this is a never ending process, but I’ve added tons of foods to the database since last time.\n* ⚖️ Better support for logging by grams - Many FitBee users log their foods with a scale, and I’ve made that simpler by adding features like letting you set the cooked weight of a recipe.\n* 🛒 One Time Purchase Option - Many people requested the ability to do a one time purchase, so that is now available.\n* ✂️Robust Shortcuts Support - Use Shortcuts to log foods, weights, water and much more.\n* 📱 Updated for iOS 26 - Full UI refresh to make it feel at home on Apple's latest OS.\n* 🌎 Localization - FitBee now supports nutrition label formats from US, UK, EU, AU & NZ.\n* 🐛 Many, many bug fixes and other improvements based on the feedback from users.\n\n# Why FitBee is different:\n\n* **Fast, lightweight and to the point** \\- The app is just about tracking your nutrition and makes that front and center. I've tried to make things that you do often as simple as possible (e.g., log yesterday's breakfast).\n* **Free barcode scanning** \\- Not much to say here except that it's free and works great!\n* **Photo Logging** \\- You can take a photo of a food and get an estimate of the calories and macros. It's not 100% accurate but it's been super helpful for me when eating at a restaurant that doesn't have published nutrition info.\n* **Accurate nutrition data** \\- The nutrition data is sourced from the USDA dataset and nutrition labels off the packages. I also spent effort adding east asian foods (e.g. things you get at 99 Ranch or Weee) to the database, since those were hard to find/track in other apps I've tried.\n* **Recipe importing** \\- You can pretty much point any recipe at the app and it'll import the ingredients and generate nutrition information for you. As I got more into fitness, I started to cook more so this has been super helpful.\n* **Robust Apple Health support** \\- You can sync data with Apple Health. I wear an Apple Watch so it's great for getting the energy burned through exercises.\n* **No Ads** \\- No ads, ever. See Pricing below on how development is supported.\n* **Premium Features** \\- FitBee offers a subset of features behind a monthly subscription. These include setting advanced nutrition goals, unlimited photo logging and unlimited recipe imports by URL.\n\n# 💰 Pricing\n\nFitBee is free for basic tracking, including barcode and nutrition label scanning and no ads. To take advantage of the premium features, you can sign up for a monthly or annual subscription. There's also a one time purchase option available (which a surprisingly many of you have used!.)\n\n**App Store Link**: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbee-calorie-macro-counter/id6443979108](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbee-calorie-macro-counter/id6443979108)\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback! I’ll be in the comments to answer questions and take feature requests.\n\n# 🌎 Availability\n\nFitBee is available in the US, CA, UK, AU, NZ currently. The main reason being that I don't have local food data yet outside of those countries. I'm hoping to expand access to more countries in 2026.\n\n# ❤️ A special thanks to this subreddit\n\nAs a special thanks to all the support and feedback I've gotten from this community, I'm giving away 10 lifetime, family sharing enabled subs.

Exclusive Promo Sunday discount is applied. \n\nThese started as Scriptable widgets that kept popping up on Reddit, calendar grids, year-progress trackers, countdown walls. People loved them. So we integrated them into the app with a proper/simpler UI for customization, and wired everything through Shortcuts so they update automatically.\n\n[Example 1](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/fluence-media/Example1.png), [Example 2](https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/fluence-media/Example2.png)\n\n**What's available (all free, all ad-free):**\n\nOn device:\n\n**Calendar** — A dot-grid monthly calendar. Configure how many months show, columns, styling. Widget-safe padding so it doesn't get covered.\n\n**Year View** — A full-year grid where each day fills in as it passes. Shows days remaining at the bottom. Surprisingly motivating (or terrifying, depending on your outlook).\n\n**Countdown** — Pick a date, get a visual countdown that fills daily. Optionally renders over a random wallpaper from the library.\n\nServer side: these are premium locked.\n\n**Daily Random** — Fetches a new wallpaper every day (or hour). Set it and forget it.\n\n**Category Random** — Same as above but filtered to categories you pick.\n\nEverything except the two \"random\" modules runs **100% on-device**. No server calls, no tracking. The random ones obviously need to fetch images, but they're clearly marked.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nYou configure the wallpaper in-app, then add it to a Shortcuts automation (there's a one-tap import). Set your schedule, every morning, every hour, whatever.

Since iOS is so complicated there will always be exploits in the system. There are companies like NSO Group that specialize in finding these exploits. For example they could find an exploit in how iOS processes gifs and use that to hack into a phone. They sell that as a product named Pegasus.\n\nFinding these exploits is extremely expensive and mostly bought by state intelligence. It’s for high profile targets. Recent examples are President Macron and Jeff Bezos being targeted. But an authoritarian regime could also use it to spy on journalists if they are seen as enough of a threat. \n\nRemember this a cat and mouse situation between these companies and Apple/Google/Microsoft security. So once an exploit is used it’s probably junk. It’s too expensive for regular people to be concerned with. For all intents and purposes the FBI or any other law enforcement cannot get into a modern iOS device unless the person is a massive military target. \n\nIf I did a shit job at explaining look up Pegasus.

This will likely be especially useful when astronauts are conducting an experiment or looking outside a window and see an interesting, transient phenomenon.\n\n>However, Isaacman said the decision to allow astronauts to bring iPhones is about more than just capturing cool new photos and videos. It’s part of his effort to challenge long-standing NASA rules and requirements.\n\n>“Just as important, we challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline,” he wrote. “That operational urgency will serve NASA well as we pursue the highest-value science and research in orbit and on the lunar surface. This is a small step in the right direction.”\n\n>The challenge of qualifying modern technology for spaceflight is real. There are a million ways in which the technology can become mired in the approval process, from radiation characterization of chips to battery thermal and vacuum tests, outgassing concerns, vibe testing, and other qualification concerns. Yes, these requirements exist for a reason. But Isaacman is now telling his team to challenge requirements to ensure they are still needed today. (If you don’t believe this is important, ask any NASA contractor about bloated requirements.)\n\n>Smartphones have flown to orbit before. For example, two iPhone 4s flew on board the final space shuttle mission in 2011, though it’s not clear whether the crew ever touched them. For the most part, though, astronauts living on board the International Space Station over the last decade have used tablets to connect to the Internet and communicate with family members.\n\n>Astronauts flying on private missions, including Isaacman’s Polaris flight and the Axiom missions to the space station, did bring smartphones.", "author": "ControlCAD", "score": 29, "created_utc": 1770329400.0}, {"id": "o3tpho8", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "So do they have to put it in Airplane mode or what ?", "author": "InItsTeeth", "score": 12, "created_utc": 1770341593.0}, {"id": "o3w8wuf", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "Well, Spaceship mode", "author": "Current-Bowl-143", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1770383312.0}, {"id": "o3svz0l", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "Mom:  Don’t text and drive\nMe: The astronauts do it", "author": "RegularFinger8", "score": 23, "created_utc": 1770331554.0}, {"id": "o3syuv9", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "The astronauts got clearance from NASA, did you?", "author": "Manos_Of_Fate", "score": 11, "created_utc": 1770332453.0}, {"id": "o3sysi0", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "Roaming charges will bankrupt the astronauts", "author": "TheDogFather", "score": 26, "created_utc": 1770332433.0}, {"id": "o3tw5id", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "One hour of free inflight WiFi from Boingo should help keep cost down! ;)", "author": "bullinchinastore", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1770343984.0}, {"id": "o3trjhn", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "How in the fuck did they think it was a great idea not to live stream this mission, what a total disaster", "author": "ReactorSaIt", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1770342333.0}, {"id": "o3w4akh", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "Wonder where photos will be put on the Map in the gallery.", "author": "lord_phantom_pl", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1770381570.0}, {"id": "o3su5gc", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "Location services will be a challenge.", "author": "ae74", "score": 21, "created_utc": 1770330991.0}, {"id": "o3tazag", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "Location: Out of this world!", "author": "SpiveyJr", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1770336514.0}, {"id": "o3wbuhq", "post_id": "1qwz4b9", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "A problem with electronics in space is cosmic and solar radiation.

Transfers are able to be started during the device setup process, and moving data from one device to another can be done without having to download apps from Apple and Google.\n\n>The transfer process supports moving photos, messages, notes, apps, passwords, phone numbers, and more, and it's not too surprising that Apple isn't advertising it. Data transfers were already possible, though not quite as simple, and Apple likely doesn't want to encourage users to move to a different platform.\n\n>In December, the European Union took credit for the new transfer tool, touting it as an example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers. Google and Apple apparently implemented the feature because the DMA requires services to offer interoperability to prevent customers from being locked in to an operating system. The two companies opted to add the functionality worldwide rather than just in the EU.\n\n>iOS 26.3 includes a setting to limit carrier location tracking, though it is limited to a few select carriers worldwide. In the United States, only Boost Mobile is supporting the feature as of now. EE and BT in the UK offer it, as does Telekom in Germany and AIS and True in Thailand. It is a feature available only for devices with C1 or C1X modems.\n\n>In the iOS 26.3 beta, Apple added other Europe-only changes for third-party wearables, which were shared by the European Commission.

These included a $1bn acquisition of Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019, a $600mn acquisition of Dialog Semiconductor in 2018 and a $500mn acquisition of Israeli flash memory firm Anobit in 2011.\n\n>Other more recent deals have reflected the iPhone maker’s focus on computer vision and artificial intelligence, following the launch of the Vision Pro headset and ‘Apple IIntelligence’, its suite of AI features. These include last year’s acquisitions of Israeli 3D avatar start-up TrueMeeting and generative AI company Pointable.\n\n>Q.AI was founded by Aviad Maizels, Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya in Tel Aviv in 2022. It has been operating largely in secret ever since, with Wexler hinting in a social media post soon after it launched: “I can’t tell you anything yet about our product — but I bet it will leave you speechless.”\n\n>Its financial backers also include Kleiner Perkins, Spark Capital and Exor.\n\n>Some of Q.AI’s team previously worked on another Israeli start-up, PrimeSense, that Apple acquired in 2013.

Even if a developer wants to publish to an alt store, he still needs to go through the process like for the official one: legally register with Apple (requires a national ID for private persons), pay an annual subscription fee of 100€/$, and submit apps to Apple for notarisations (otherwise they can't be installed on devices even if they are distributed via an alt stores).\n\nOnce the developer has gone through all that, they can publish either on the App Store or the Alt Store. Why, after all efforts and hurdles, should a developer select the Alt Store with a much, MUCH, smaller audience? Why the end user shall install AltStores if developers prefer official store? Of course, the official App Store looks waaaaay more attractive/easier with a bigger audience once a lot of money and effort have already been spent.\n\nDevs will not select the official stores only when their apps have some VERY specific requirements that won't pass Apple's review, like emulators. This raises quite uncomfortable questions though. If emulators aren't allowed in the official store due to some security concerns, but can be installed through alt stores, then Apple is okay if user devices can be compromised? Then, if they are okay that devices could be compromised through alt stores, then why do they act as a gatekeeper asking for an annual fee and require notarisation? If their system is good enough and alt store apps can't compromise devices, then why emulators aren’t allowed in the App Store? Something doesn't match in their rhetoric.\n\nNeedless to say, in this uneven situation, it's hard to open and maintain an Apple-approved store, which also requires going through all Apple's processes. This effectively zeroes out all efforts as Apple has done everything to protect its profits.\n\nAll that kills the whole idea of alt stores. If Apple were to remove all these obstacles, I strongly believe the situation would be totally different, and Apple knows it and it doesn't like it.\n\nAlso, Apple can't sell me the \"privacy and security\" narratives as my company's MacBook contains a lot more confidential and sensitive information, but I or company still can install apps directly from developers.

Updated Weight - The ‌AirTag‌ 2 weighs 0.42 ounces or 11.8 grams. it is seven percent heavier than the original ‌AirTag‌.\n\n8. Revamped Text - The text on the back of the ‌AirTag‌ is now all in capital letters, which is a good way to determine whether an ‌AirTag‌ is the first-generation model or the new model. The text also now lists IP67 water and dust resistance, plus it mentions NFC and Find My support. These features aren't new, but aren't listed on the back of the original ‌AirTag‌.\n\n9. Still Not For Pets - Apple's ‌AirTag‌ 2 announcement and product page specifically state that the device is for tracking objects, and not people or pets. Despite this, many people use AirTags for tracking their animals.\n\n10. Reset Process - To reset an ‌AirTag‌ 2, you need to remove the battery, leave it out for at least five seconds, and then insert the battery again. The process has to be repeated four times. Apple says that it can take up to 12 seconds to hear the final tone. With the first ‌AirTag‌, there was no need to wait after removing the battery before reinserting it.\n\n11. Requires iOS 26.2.1 - If you want to use an ‌AirTag‌ 2, you're going to have to update your device to iOS 26.2.1. The ‌AirTag‌ 2 requires the latest Apple software, which means it won't work with devices that aren't able to run iOS 26.", "author": "Few_Baseball_3835", "score": 904, "created_utc": 1769492697.0}, {"id": "o1yvimd", "post_id": "1qo59n4", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "I've been waiting for Revamped Text", "author": "spectracide_", "score": 872, "created_utc": 1769493165.0}, {"id": "o1yvms3", "post_id": "1qo59n4", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "I feel like that line about pets is something to do with liability.

Based on that timeframe, Intel could supply Apple with at least a portion of A21 or A22 chips for future iPhone models, if the companies agree to a partnership.\n\nApple's return to Intel might also involve some Mac and iPad chips. Last year, Tianfeng Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expected Intel to begin shipping Apple's lowest-end M-series chip for select Mac and iPad models as early as mid-2027. For this, Kuo said Apple planned to utilize Intel's 18A process. He did not mention the iPhone.\n\nThere is no indication that Intel would play a role in designing the iPhone chips, with its involvement expected to be strictly limited to fabrication. That would differ from the era of Intel Macs, which used Intel-designed processors with x86 architecture. Apple began transitioning away from Intel processors in Macs in 2020.\n\nIntel would help Apple diversify its supply chain, which could come at a pivotal time, as Nvidia has reportedly surpassed Apple as TSMC's largest customer amid rising competition for NAND memory and RAM chip supply for AI servers.\n\nTSMC is not the only chip supplier seeing increased demand amid the AI server boom, as Samsung and SK Hynix have both gained enough leverage to demand Apple pay more for RAM chips, according to The Wall Street Journal's supply chain sources.\n\nOn an earnings call last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that rising memory chip prices had a \"minimal impact\" on Apple's gross margin last quarter, but he does expect a \"bit more of an impact\" on the company's gross margin in the current quarter. He said Apple \"will look at a range of options to deal with that\" as necessary.\n\nApple reported record-breaking revenue of $143.8 billion last quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and it is predicting similar 13% to 16% year-over-year growth and gross margin of 48% to 49% in the current quarter, so the company is still reporting impressive earnings results despite concerns surrounding memory chip prices.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo does not expect price increases for the iPhone 18 lineup.”", "author": "CounterThrowCyborg", "score": 475, "created_utc": 1770005351.0}, {"id": "o33m1iu", "post_id": "1qtkrp5", "subreddit": "apple", "body": "Thanks.

Like the longer you are on YouTube the harder it is to find new things, even if you use their \"show me something new\" button. I could potentially see a similar problem here.\n\nI dunno.
