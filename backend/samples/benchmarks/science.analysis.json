Additionally, the nature of these changes may be evolving over time or differ depending on the nature of the event in question. Given the intensity of the rhetoric surrounding gun violence leading up to the 2024 election, we sought to examine the extent to which firearm purchasing patterns, intentions, and behaviors changed following the 2024 Presidential election and the extent to which any such changes varied by population.\n\nMethods\n\nA nationally representative sample was recruited to complete an online survey October 22-November 3, 2024 (n = 1,530) and assessed again January 7-January 22, 2025 (n = 1,359).\n\nResults\n\n**Identifying as Black was associated with increases in urges to carry firearms because of the election results (β = 0.16; 95%CI = 0.07-0.61). Liberal beliefs were associated with greater increases in urges to carry firearms because of the election results** (β = 0.11; 95%CI = 0.01-0.13) and greater odds of storing firearms more quickly accessible because of the election results (OR = 2.11; 95%CI = 1.29–3.44).\n\nConclusions\n\n**Individuals threatened by Trump administration policies to be experiencing urges to acquire firearms, carry them, and store them readily accessible**. These results highlight that the current political environment may be fostering community-level decision making that, while motivated by the drive for protection, increases the risk for harm. Policies and programs that encourage secure storage and discourage firearm carrying may be increasingly important for the prevention of injury and death.\n\nFull-text PDF of paper:\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40621-026-00654-9_reference.pdf", "author": "mvea", "score": 46, "created_utc": 1769814231.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8824964761734009, "compound_score": -0.0563, "scores": {"negative": 0.0869, "neutral": 0.8825, "positive": 0.0306}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2p7j8u", "post_id": "1qrl2wh", "subreddit": "science", "body": ">following the 2024 Presidential election\n\nI know they have to be generally vague given the timeline, but saying it was \"because of the election results\" instead of everything that happened after is implying a lot that may not stand up to scrutiny.

Beyond reporting (or non-reporting) issues, something is wrong with the data they're collecting. Really wrong. I checked it out and saw that the survey was updated in July 2025, and I think the timing here is too relevant not to piece it all together as a warning to others.\n\nI received a CDC vaccination survey call, and I happen to be familiar with population-level survey research. There's a language to it, questions hidden between the questions. When you pay attention, you can see what endpoints are most important to the interview based on what topics receive the most revisiting (confirmation of prior responses and establishment of severity/strength) and what topics receive the most broad rephrasing (detection of deception, misunderstanding, malingering, or misreporting).The survey I received made me really uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that I thought about stopping the interview several times. I finished because it felt important to really see the full picture of what they were doing, since I'm part of the maybe one in ten people they could speak to who would know to look. \n\nThe survey was presumably about vaccine history and attitudes towards vaccines. They did ask about vaccine history and attitudes, but it made up less than half of the interview and received little to no revisiting. The overwhelming majority of the interview was demographic data. Specifically, they asked no less than 3 times if anyone in my house was Hispanic/Latino, asked our races multiple times, asked for my and my husband's sexual orientation twice, and asked 3 distinct questions meant to really hanmer down our income level. That is, to put it mildly but succinctly, incredibly odd. Demographic data usually will not make up more than 10 distinct items altogether, will take no more than 5 minutes, and will only be asked once. I've never seen a survey where the demographic data received confirmatory assessment with modified wording to detect deception before that call. \n\nIf you are part of a vulnerable population, for the first time in my career, I'm going to STRONGLY encourage you to decline any calls from the CDC for the immediate future.

The expert on security policy in the Arctic explains the backdrop for US interest in Greenland – and calls for European countries to do their part to ensure lasting security policy for the Arctic region.\n\nAs the US administration led by Donald Trump has continued to reassert its interest in owning Greenland, Europe has become more and more concerned about the security situation in the Arctic. In her project \"Mapping Strategic Convergence: The Arctic and Hybrid Threats in Northern Europe\", political scientist Gabriella Gricius from the Zukunftskolleg at the University of Konstanz studies how European security policy must readjust to the new situation in the Arctic. Gricius recommends looking to the Nordics as a good example of how states can work together across the Baltic, Nordic, Arctic and High Atlantic and respond to a changed security reality. The political scientist also makes it clear that an annexation or purchase of Greenland would not strengthen the security of the USA and NATO, but would instead considerably weaken it.\n\nUS security interests are already sufficiently guaranteed in its existing trilateral defence agreement with Greenland and Denmark, Gricius concludes: \"The United States already has access to everything it needs from Greenland to defend itself, in particular, the US military base in Greenland: the Pituffik Space Base (previously Thule Air Base). **By purchasing Greenland or taking it over via illegal military means, the US would actively harm its own national security, the security of NATO and the overall security of the international, democratic, rules-based order**.\" Ultimately, an annexation would endanger NATO solidarity and relations with Europe. \"Without the support of NATO and current European allies, the United States would be in a much weaker position on the world stage. This would make it much easier for countries like Russia and China to take hold in other countries\", Gricius warns.\n\nFor those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00108367251364175", "author": "mvea", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768942949.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.7168244123458862, "compound_score": -0.2388, "scores": {"negative": 0.261, "neutral": 0.7168, "positive": 0.0222}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o0qjmec", "post_id": "1qiddcc", "subreddit": "science", "body": "I think if anyone has not realized by this point that this admin WANTS to harm the overall security of the international, rules-based order, then they're missing something.", "author": "2grim4u", "score": 6314, "created_utc": 1768943062.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.878355085849762, "compound_score": -0.8715, "scores": {"negative": 0.8784, "neutral": 0.1147, "positive": 0.0069}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o0qmh3q", "post_id": "1qiddcc", "subreddit": "science", "body": "I'm not saying that he's a Russian asset, but it sure is interesting how everything he does benefits Russia...", "author": "BellyCrawler", "score": 2029, "created_utc": 1768943853.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.6643967032432556, "compound_score": 0.03, "scores": {"negative": 0.1528, "neutral": 0.6644, "positive": 0.1828}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o0qlsf1", "post_id": "1qiddcc", "subreddit": "science", "body": "Yeah, authoritarians hate democracy and regulations that protect human rights and defense against exploitation.

The truth is that the US presidency, like any national executive leadership position, is a carefully curated seat that is subject to bureacratic inertia and dependent upon the support of multiple powerbrokers and factions. This is even true of autocratic regimes, but is much more true of multiparty representative democracies (a model of governance basically developed to share power with a larger and more diverse pool of elites).\n\nIf Trump were to keel over tomorrow, this course would continue under whoever was able to gather the confidence of the same backing factions and powerbrokers (probably Vance). If neither Trump nor Vance ever ran in the first place, in all likelihood some other politician would be situated at the locus of the same political-economical seasonal shift we're witnessing.\n\nIf you reject the 'Great Man Theory' of history (which you should), then it also follows that a 'Rogue Idiot Theory' is likewise not a satisfactory model for how and why history happens. The recent geopolitical motions of the American right wing have been surprising and perplexing for me too, but I wouldn't jump to dismiss it as irrational and accidental. Rather, there seems to be a realignment taking place that runs contrary to the established assumptions. \n\nWhy would the US undermine it's own 'rules based order' it erected to assert it's own hegemony upon the world? One can only speculate, but my suspicion is that enough of the aforementioned powerbrokers and key backing factions have become convinced that the incumbent model upon which US hegemony is currently based is not sustainable.

One year ago, we actually saw a couple of US politicians openly say that \"the international courts are for Africa\". Maduro was just broadly accused of being \"a dictator\" (implying that not doing what the US wants = being a dictator) and was abducted from his own country, while Netanyahu can just freely fly wherever he wants. The last time when Israel conducted a terrorist attack on Iran (targeting Iranian civilian scientists in their homes with their families, including 5 car bombs exploded on the streets), Netanyahu was safely in Greece. A country that is a full member of all the supposedly neutral and objective \"international institutions\". \n\nSo the international rules-based order does exist, but it is not what most of the people imagine it to be. The European countries are mostly appealing to Trump by listing all the cool crimes and murder of poor people that they did together (\"We went to Iraq with you\"), recent texts from Macron to Trump are a good example of that. Macron also mentioned \"future cooperation in Iran\", trying to get Trump to skip Greenland and move to destroying Iran, probably killing millions.\n\n-\n\nP.s.: Iran is a member of the IAEA and is following their rules (or at least they were until the recent Israeli & US attack) and is not building a nuclear weapon. Israel is not a member of the IAEA and has nuclear weapons. US is the only country to have ever used nuclear weapons on a civilian target. Yet the IAEA had nothing to say when Israel & the US bombed Iran and killed Iranian civilian scientists. Not only that, I strongly suspect the US & Israel got the names and  locations of those scientists from the IAEA.

Lycoming has initiated efforts to understand the cause of VSR. In an update provided in April 2024, Lycoming shared the results of their efforts. It indicated that UL94 may impact VSR under certain conditions. However, the influence of fuel characteristics and combustion dynamics is a complex issue, making it difficult to determine a potential root cause.  \n• In December 2024, AvWeb reported that G100UL unleaded fuel appears to damage aircraft paint under specific circumstances, according to a California Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic (A&P) who conducted his own compatibility tests on it and 100LL. The mechanic also said new nitrile O-rings swelled beyond certified limits when submerged in the unleaded fuel for five to six days. GAMI recommends replacing nitrile components with those made of silicone or fluoropolymer elastomers.  \n• In June 2024, Cirrus released Service Advisory SA24-14, identifying specific concerns with G100UL causing the degradation of fuel tank sealant. Again, multiple factors ranging from substrate preparations through fuel chemistry all potentially play a role in the observed degradation, making the root cause determination difficult despite continued efforts by both the fuel developer and Cirrus.\n\nAgain, they're working on it, but it takes time to test and sort out all the issues.\n\nMost of the pilots I know are taking a wait-and-see approach, since they don't want to risk damaging their engines until the recommendations are final.", "author": "otterbarks", "score": 141, "created_utc": 1770070787.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8068618178367615, "compound_score": -0.1113, "scores": {"negative": 0.1522, "neutral": 0.8069, "positive": 0.0409}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o38fiyo", "post_id": "1qu8k6t", "subreddit": "science", "body": "Still in common use by piston-engine propeller aircraft\n\nNot by jets or turboprops", "author": "Lorry_Al", "score": 55, "created_utc": 1770069482.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8799930810928345, "compound_score": 0.0148, "scores": {"negative": 0.0526, "neutral": 0.88, "positive": 0.0674}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o38jowc", "post_id": "1qu8k6t", "subreddit": "science", "body": "Back in my aviation days I was taught to draw samples of 100LL from the wing tanks and just dump it onto the ground afterward.

They were instructed to keep their eyes open and let their minds wander. The scanner recorded the blood oxygen levels in their brains, which serves as a proxy for neural activity.\n* The researchers then used computational tools to analyze the functional connectivity between 106 different brain regions. They looked for specific patterns in the data described by graph theory metrics. These metrics included “global efficiency” and “local efficiency.”\n* the study found that global efficiency decreased in several areas. This was particularly evident in the occipital lobe, the part of the brain responsible for processing vision. The reduction suggests that alcohol makes it harder for visual information to integrate with the rest of the brain’s operations.\n* Simultaneously, local efficiency increased. Regions in the frontal and temporal cortices began to communicate more intensely with their immediate neighbors. The brain appeared to fracture into smaller, self-contained communities. This structure requires less energy to maintain but hinders the rapid integration of complex information.\n* The results showed that the degree of network reorganization predicted the intensity of the subjective “buzz.” Participants whose brains showed the largest drop in global efficiency and the largest rise in local clustering tended to report feeling the most intoxicated. \n  * Even at the same blood alcohol concentration, people experience varying levels of intoxication. The study suggests that individual differences in how the brain network fragments may underlie these varying subjective responses.\n* This investigation provides a nuanced view of acute intoxication. It moves beyond the idea that alcohol simply “dampens” brain activity. Instead, it reveals that alcohol forces the brain into a segregated state.

Which, yes, I agree...to an extent. Capturing these behaviors, particularly in wildlife, is incredibly difficult. You can spend years in the field tracking animals and only see a glimpse of their lives. Animals also die and disappear, so your data points drop off. \n\nHistorically, almost every line in the sand we've drawn for animal sentience has been surpassed. This is a problem when we decide to grant protections based on sentience or intelligence. While we toil over these issues (can an animal feel this pain, does an animal need this much space, etc.), animals are overharvested, subjected to what essentially amounts to torture in some cases, and persecuted (nuisance laws).\n\nObviously, assuming a high level of intelligence for every species is not possible or practical.

He said she also recognised family members’ voices and hurried to meet them when they called.\n\n“I was naturally amazed by her extraordinary intelligence and thought how much we could learn from animals: patience, calmness, contentment, and gentleness,” he said.\n\nWord soon got around and before long a video clip of the cow’s behaviour reached biologists in Vienna who specialise in animal intelligence. They immediately grasped the importance of the footage. “It was a cow using an actual tool,” said Dr Antonio Osuna Mascaró at the city’s University of Veterinary Medicine. “We got everything ready and jumped in the car to visit.”\n\nVeronika favoured the bristled end of the broom to scratch the tough skin on her back. But she switched to the smooth handle and scratched more gently when the itch was on more delicate, lower body areas such as her udders and belly, according to the study in Current Biology.\n\n“At the beginning I thought this was the result of a mistake. Perhaps Veronika was not careful enough when selecting her tool for self-scratching,” Osuna Mascaró said. “But after a while we started to observe a pattern: Veronika indeed had a preference for using the broom end, but when she used the handle end she was doing so in a meaningful way.”\n\nTool use is well known in chimps, crows, dolphins and even octopuses. The latter have been filmed throwing shells at one another. But livestock have never been considered the sharpest of animals.\n\nVeronika is far from making even misshapen tools, but her prowess in using them has impressed nonetheless. Over seven sessions of 10 trials, the researchers witnessed 76 instances of tool use as she grabbed the broom to scratch otherwise unreachable regions. **Using both ends of the brush counts as multi-purpose tool use, the scientists say, which is extraordinarily rare. Beyond humans, it has only been shown convincingly in chimpanzees.**\n\nFor those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01597-0", "author": "mvea", "score": 75, "created_utc": 1768908323.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8384398221969604, "compound_score": 0.0627, "scores": {"negative": 0.0494, "neutral": 0.8384, "positive": 0.1121}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o0or3at", "post_id": "1qhykjx", "subreddit": "science", "body": "And this is after 10,000 years of selective breeding.

The revelations could explain why certain populations of cells that detect and fight infection are depleted in patients with severe COVID-19, and shed light on the omicron variant’s milder symptoms.\n\nThe study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may launch a line of inquiry that informs new strategies for quelling the most serious symptoms of COVID-19. Led by a UCLA team, the scientific collaboration comprises nearly three dozen engineers, microbiologists, immunologists, chemists, physicists, medical researchers and analytical experts. Authors are based at universities, medical centers and national laboratories and institutes in the United States, China, Germany, India and Italy. The research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe team’s findings build on an earlier UCLA discovery identifying “**zombie” coronavirus fragments that can imitate the activity of molecules from the body’s own immune system to drive inflammation**. Now, not only have the researchers shown that human immune enzymes can break down the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into such fragments, they found that some fragments can work together to attack important types of immune cells by targeting their cell shapes.\n\nFor those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2521841122", "author": "mvea", "score": 409, "created_utc": 1769947841.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.7400257587432861, "compound_score": -0.2046, "scores": {"negative": 0.2323, "neutral": 0.74, "positive": 0.0277}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2yzcrp", "post_id": "1qswu22", "subreddit": "science", "body": "Covid is a real POS sometimes", "author": "plastic_alloys", "score": 172, "created_utc": 1769954744.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.9281291961669922, "compound_score": -0.9183, "scores": {"negative": 0.9281, "neutral": 0.062, "positive": 0.0099}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2z7bir", "post_id": "1qswu22", "subreddit": "science", "body": "That sounds like it would help explain the weird symptoms I had for 5 months (twice!) after a very mild case of COVID.", "author": "OUEngineer17", "score": 39, "created_utc": 1769957376.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.4955931007862091, "compound_score": -0.3114, "scores": {"negative": 0.4079, "neutral": 0.4956, "positive": 0.0965}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2z5ai5", "post_id": "1qswu22", "subreddit": "science", "body": "For some one who doesn't speak medical science that well, are they saying this is the cause of long covid/pots?", "author": "MoonHunterDancer", "score": 49, "created_utc": 1769956731.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.5210828185081482, "compound_score": -0.5062, "scores": {"negative": 0.5211, "neutral": 0.464, "positive": 0.0149}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2ymd9t", "post_id": "1qswu22", "subreddit": "science", "body": "I have no clue what that means in detail, but it reads very bad. \n\nIf someone has a text for the scientific illiterate normies, like me, I'll be very happy.", "author": "KervyN", "score": 218, "created_utc": 1769949732.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.8895061016082764, "compound_score": -0.8735, "scores": {"negative": 0.8895, "neutral": 0.0945, "positive": 0.016}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2yrudz", "post_id": "1qswu22", "subreddit": "science", "body": "The headline is a bit rough, as it makes the \"fragments\" appear to be actively *and intentionally* causing harm to the body.  *The virus is not active.*  \n^(*edit added in italics*)  \n\nYour immune system destroyed the virus, but protein fragments of the destroyed virus's walls are passively binding to other immune cells and causing a \"false alarm\" that triggers a further immune response in your body that presents as inflammation.  \n\n\nAs an analogy, you've blown up the landmine that was lying in wait for you, but the metal fragments are still puncturing tyres of vehicles passing by the site of the blast and causing emergency responses to assist the affected vehicles.", "author": "WillyPete", "score": 521, "created_utc": 1769952007.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.8119965195655823, "compound_score": -0.8051, "scores": {"negative": 0.812, "neutral": 0.1811, "positive": 0.0069}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2zrefq", "post_id": "1qswu22", "subreddit": "science", "body": "it can be. covid gave me the post-viral disease me/cfs after my first infection and i’ve been pretty severely disabled ever since. unfortunately happened while i was applying to med schools", "author": "toysalesman", "score": 11, "created_utc": 1769963214.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.897627592086792, "compound_score": -0.8918, "scores": {"negative": 0.8976, "neutral": 0.0966, "positive": 0.0058}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2z4ybi", "post_id": "1qswu22", "subreddit": "science", "body": "It takes a massive toll on the immune system even after recovery.

Then, even in those categories, after the adjustment for body mass, the \"worse\" group had a significantly wider range of outcomes. The \"better\" group was clustered all together and the \"worse\" group had people wayyyy better, some in the middle, and a bunch wayyyy worse.

Which tells me, the layman, that the difference was more a massive difference in body mass (heavier) than a massive difference in ability. \n\nThe conclusion by the authors was that the \"worse\" group had no advantage and was actually at a disadvantage in general even though it only played out that way in a couple categories and only when adjusted.

Back in 2021, as the cases of VITT emerged, he and others were unsure of what precipitated them. One theory was that they were caused by the body’s accidental reaction to the type of virus used in both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines:  adenoviruses, which had been engineered to prompt the body to recognize the pandemic coronavirus but were unable to replicate and considered harmless to people. Scientists had noticed that patients with VITT had telltale markers in their blood—antibodies that bind to a chemical signal released by platelets. Maybe a reaction to the adenovirus was causing immune cells to mistakenly go after a blood component and precipitate clotting. An alternative theory was that the body was reacting to a portion of the coronavirus called “spike protein,” which showed up as part of the immunization.\n>\n>In a study published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, Greinacher and his colleagues show that the first theory was correct: VITT was a response to the adenovirus gone awry. And they discovered a further twist: This immune overreaction happened in people who were genetically prone to it.\n>\n>In the study, Greinacher and his colleagues looked at the antibodies in stored blood from 21 patients with VITT. Among those antibodies, they found a subset that could glom on to a portion of the adenovirus and to one of the body’s own molecules, PF4, that can influence blood clotting. A person who received one of the adenovirus vaccines but did not have a reaction also had antibodies against that same part of the adenovirus. But, crucially, that person’s antibodies did not cross-react with PF4.\n>\n>Those antibody molecules also offered clues about the immune cells that made them. And the scientists were able to link the immune cells responsible for VITT to patients who had two specific DNA variants. A wider survey of 100 VITT patients found that all of them had immune cells with one of these genetic types—which are far from universal. This signaled to the researchers that having these particular variants is a strong risk factor for blood clotting following an adenovirus vaccine.\n>\n>But the study also showed that this genetic background on its own was not enough to cause VITT. The immune cells that made the dangerous antibodies had experienced an additional small genetic change, and that extra mutation had prompted them to produce those cross-reactive molecules.\n>\n>In the past, scientists have suggested that genetic predispositions might explain some adverse events that happen after vaccination. For example, some data have indicated that certain people were genetically prone to developing narcolepsy following a version of swine-flu vaccine that was briefly used in Europe. But the new study from Greinacher and his team is the first to provide concrete evidence of how people with a particular DNA variant can develop self-sabotaging antibodies following a vaccination. Arnold Lining Ju, a biomedical engineer at the University of Sydney who has studied blood clotting, told me that the paper was a landmark finding in part because of how elegantly it explains the way a specific genetic trait, combined with a particular chance mutation in certain cells, creates VITT. And because the study shows that multiple genetic changes are involved, it finally explains why this immune reaction is so rare, he said.\n>\n>...\n>\n>These results also mean that adenovirus-based vaccines could be made safer if they can be designed without the protein region that triggered the dangerous antibodies in VITT. “Instead of abandoning an entire vaccine platform because of a rare problem, we can engineer around the specific issue, and that’s the power of this kind of science,” Joann Arce of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital told me. The hope is that understanding the biology of a rare event like VITT, and then addressing it, helps bolster public trust in vaccines too. Greinacher told me that adenovirus-based vaccines remain vital, including for the development of vaccines for diseases that affect mostly low- and middle-income countries. The shots could also be useful in a future pandemic, because they can be scaled up in production relatively quickly.\n\n---\n\nJournal link:\n\n[Adenoviral Inciting Antigen and Somatic Hypermutation in VITT](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2514824)\n\nAbstract:\n\n>**Background**\n>\n>Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a rare prothrombotic complication that occurs after adenoviral vector–based vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019; in rare cases, it can also occur after natural adenovirus infection. VITT is mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against the highly cationic protein platelet factor 4 (PF4). The underlying inciting antigen trigger and immunopathogenesis remain unknown.\n>\n>**Methods**\n>\n>We used antibody proteomics to determine the amino acid sequences of anti-PF4 antibodies from 21 patients with VITT and sequenced the genes encoding the immunoglobulin light-chain hypervariable region from 100 patients with VITT. To identify an adenoviral trigger, we used the antigen-binding fingerprints of anti-PF4 and anti–adenovirus protein antibodies to identify a shared serum clonotype and subsequently used adenovirus protein peptides and recombinant anti-PF4 VITT antibodies to map the mimicking linear epitope.\n>\n>**Results**\n>\n>Genomic and proteomic profiling of VITT antibodies revealed a shared immunoglobulin light-chain allele, IGLV3-21*02 or *03, harboring a critical somatic hypermutation, K31E. Only antibodies purified against adenoviral core protein VII (pVII) contained anti-PF4 species matching the VITT fingerprint; antibodies against intact virions or other adenoviral proteins did not. Cross-reactive IgGs were mapped to a basic linear epitope on pVII. A pathogenic anti-PF4 VITT antibody, back-mutated to germline (K31), lost its prothrombotic activity in vitro and in vivo and preferentially bound pVII, a finding that directly supported the role of the hypermutation in the antigenic shift from adenovirus pVII to PF4.\n>\n>**Conclusions**\n>\n>The results of our study indicate that VITT occurs when, in persons with immunoglobulin light-chain allele IGLV3-21*02 or *03, a specific somatic hypermutation develops that affects antibodies that recognize a specific epitope on the adenoviral core protein pVII, which results in misdirection of antibody targeting toward PF4.", "author": "Hrmbee", "score": 1254, "created_utc": 1770855830.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8746630549430847, "compound_score": -0.0349, "scores": {"negative": 0.0801, "neutral": 0.8747, "positive": 0.0452}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4wuxzj", "post_id": "1r2ei18", "subreddit": "science", "body": "Interesting that binding to PF4 is also what causes Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia.

So the \"Trump supporters value large penises\" headline massively oversimplifies the nuance. \n\nRoughly 34% (Importance subscale) and 41% (Desire subscale) of non-Trump supporters would score above the sample mean on the PSVS (this is a brand new scale largely defined by a masculinity-threat writing task increased humiliation).

There was a similar increase in the positive effect of penis size on attractiveness with a more masculine body shape (i.e., greater shoulder-to-hip ratio). Surprisingly, larger penis size and greater height had almost equivalent positive effects on male attractiveness.

The Right has not really changed much on these issues since Reagan. \n\nMeanwhile, liberals compared to where they were 30 years ago have moved quite a lot on these issues. Think about where abortion is now on the Left compared to during the ACA debates. Compare the green new deal to Clinton’s “the era of big government is over.” I would push back on the assertion that liberals becoming more left leaning is due to them being more extremist; instead, its more that liberals are learning that the color-blind, morality infused, small government revolution that more or less both parties agreed on through the 80s, 90s, and into the 2000s was fundamentally incorrect and failed to bring about prosperity or progress (captured best by the 2008 financial crisis). In short, liberals learned from experience and science, conservatives didn’t. \n\nNow, if they had asked about the role of democracy and the dangers of authoritarianism, the authors probably would have seen significant change on the Right in recent years.

I would note that the study isn't making a moral judgment on which side is \"correct\"; it is simply measuring the magnitude of the shift. \n\nWhat’s particularly disturbing, other than the now *expected* fact that few have read the article (which belabors many aspects people here seem to be ignoring and fairly robust/interesting methodology, though I admit I'm more in the natural sciences) is that so very few people are even discussing the article’s methods or results. The only thing of interest is pretty much the title, which people are reacting to as if it was a personal attack; deflecting by saying the conservatives by definition are backwards reactionists that fail to update their social views, conflating political views/positions with methods (and failing to acknowledge Trump is also an anomaly for the right) or just plainly denying any weight to the paper based on personal judgement and feeling devoid of any rational or evidence-presentation based thinking.\n\nIf we look at recent political history, perhaps just 10-15 years ago, the conclusions of the study should be self-evident rather than controversial. The window of acceptable discourse on the Left has shifted massively in a very short time. Consider 2008: A Democrat could support wealth redistribution and unions while explicitly opposing gay marriage (a position held by Obama at the time). Today, that combination of views is virtually non-existent in the party. The Right has certainly had its own populism issues (Trump), but strictly in terms of social policy positions, the baseline conservative stance has remained relatively static compared to the rapid expansion of progressive social axioms, to anyone who has taken steps to ensure they aren't living in an echo chamber of modern progressive discourse, “cancel” culture, or social justice-oriented views. Gay rights, trans rights, equity vs equality, DEI, even abortion has long been a contentious issue. I remember having debates with others years ago about abortion and a large number of people would proudly claim to be pro-life, and even a teacher made us debate on it; there was far less vitriol, and in general people accepted that others might have differing views on these issues, even if you were on the left. \n\nThere’s been a linguistic shift in how social positions are framed; nowadays it’s all about “rights” and that they are not debatable, that these are self-evident moral absolutes and above questioning (in a massive attitude shift), that these are not “politics” but unassailable human rights and hence disagreement/discussion is not healthy politics but a moral failing and hence is forbidden (ignoring that deciding human rights and how humans are treated has always been the domain of politics and public policy, and people have never reached full agreement on these aspects. Rights are social constructs defined by law and consensus; by definition they are political.), universities and online communities will often censor “conservative” views or ban them (I do believe the accusation that universities are hotbeds of liberal propaganda, though I will note propaganda can be true, it’s just the attitude with respect to how it is disseminated. One aspect is whether you are allowed to question it, or how ever-present it is.) and the attitude that these are captured ground in modern political discourse, despite the simple fact that they aren’t, or if they were, it was a recent shift and large pockets of resistance remain, partly due to the speed of the change. The online popular left has simply retreated to their trenches, decided that it didn’t need the opinion of the other side, then keeps on digging new trenches and then pretending they were always there. More educated folks and scholars will of course do better, but even they are not absent of bias. (Not that the right is much more rational, but on the Overton window shift they are right.)\n\nI’m not particularly criticizing the political positions themselves, in the obligatory “I’m not on the right” disclaimer that now seems to be mandatory even in r/science to be given any consideration. As an atheist rule utilitarian and someone who has considered themselves to be generally progressive for years, who’s currently pursing graduate education and generally interacts only with liberal/progressive circles and doesn’t directly know many conservative people, I do subscribe to many of these views that have taken ahold of the left.\n\nEven then, it’s clear that the window of acceptable discourse has shifted far to the left. People of Reddit, accept that and discuss from there, the methods, the conclusions, political insights, etc. You don’t need to shift your views to accept the conclusions of the article.\n\nI wrote a long reply here because I guess I’ve become more upset lately with how polarized social media has become. It’s okay to disagree, it’s okay to be determined and certain in one’s views, what is not is censorship of the opposition, never listening to other perspectives, or pretending that one’s beliefs (or the party’s) have always been what they are, and cannot be discussed.

These findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how feelings of inadequacy coexist with high standards**. The study was published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.\n\nThe data analysis revealed that overall feelings of imposterism were positively correlated with total perfectionism scores. When the researchers examined the specific subtypes, they found distinct patterns. Participants who scored high on imposterism also tended to score high on rigid perfectionism. A similar strong positive relationship was observed between imposterism and self-critical perfectionism.\n\nA different pattern emerged regarding narcissistic perfectionism. The analysis showed no significant relationship between feelings of being an imposter and narcissistic perfectionism. This suggests that the grandiose belief in one’s own superiority does not typically coexist with the paralyzing self-doubt of imposter syndrome.\n\nThe researchers also looked at the specific components of imposterism to understand these dynamics better. They found that the tendency to discount one’s own success was negatively correlated with narcissistic perfectionism. This means that individuals who view themselves as superior are significantly less likely to minimize their achievements.\n\nThe results provide evidence that narcissistic perfectionism functions differently from other forms of perfectionism. It is characterized by self-defensiveness and self-promotion rather than the self-deprecation seen in imposterism. This distinction helps explain why some high achievers suffer from anxiety and procrastination while others maintain a robust, if sometimes unrealistic, self-view.\n\nFor those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886925005914", "author": "mvea", "score": 231, "created_utc": 1769339115.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.7410169243812561, "compound_score": -0.1545, "scores": {"negative": 0.2068, "neutral": 0.741, "positive": 0.0522}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o1lpqug", "post_id": "1qmg985", "subreddit": "science", "body": "I'm so glad, they once told me that being too self critical was a sing of narcissism, so I had to add narcissism to my list of defects.", "author": "CalmEntry4855", "score": 287, "created_utc": 1769341358.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "confidence": 0.45597124099731445, "compound_score": 0.1637, "scores": {"negative": 0.2923, "neutral": 0.2517, "positive": 0.456}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o1ny5eh", "post_id": "1qmg985", "subreddit": "science", "body": "Self critical perfectionism - I must be perfect\n\nNarcissistic perfectionism - I am perfect\n\nCurious which one may be linked to imposter syndrome", "author": "ElPapo131", "score": 13, "created_utc": 1769365986.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.6137750744819641, "compound_score": -0.1187, "scores": {"negative": 0.2525, "neutral": 0.6138, "positive": 0.1337}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o1lpkiy", "post_id": "1qmg985", "subreddit": "science", "body": "This is cool science, even if it’s an”obvious” result.

New research from neuroscientists at the University of Bristol reveals that **repeated, long-term exposure to bodily waste significantly reduces parents’ disgust responses, with effects that persist over time.**\n\nThe findings, published in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, offer fresh insight into how caregiving reshapes the brain and **could help inform strategies to support workers in professions where managing disgust is part of the job.**\n\nMany professions require regular contact with unpleasant substances, including bodily waste, making some roles difficult to recruit and retain staff. Researchers from Bristol sought to better understand how disgust functions, with the aim of identifying ways to help people cope with it more effectively.\n\n“Parenthood dramatically increases exposure to these substances, and people do not choose to become, or stop being, parents based on disgust. This makes it an ideal ‘natural experiment’ for studying how disgust changes over time.”\n\nAs expected, non-parents showed strong avoidance of images depicting bodily waste. Parents, however, displayed a strikingly different pattern but only once their children had begun eating solid food.\n\nParents of weaning or weaned children showed little to no behavioural avoidance of soiled nappies or even general bodily effluvia. Their disgust response appeared noticeably reduced, suggesting that prolonged, unavoidable exposure had led to desensitisation. Importantly, this reduced disgust was not limited to child-related stimuli but generalised to other forms of bodily waste.\n\nIn contrast, parents whose youngest children were still exclusively milk-fed showed levels of disgust avoidance similar to those of non-parents, even if they had older children. This unexpected finding suggests that disgust may remain heightened during the earliest stage of infancy, when babies are particularly vulnerable to illness.\n\nThe researchers believe this pattern may reflect an evolutionary adaptive response. Heightened disgust during the milk-feeding stage could help reduce disease risk for young infants, while later desensitisation allows parents to care for their children when they are ill.\n\nFor those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sjop.70069", "author": "mvea", "score": 17, "created_utc": 1768648193.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.5756491422653198, "compound_score": -0.3669, "scores": {"negative": 0.3957, "neutral": 0.5756, "positive": 0.0287}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o03m92l", "post_id": "1qfajgo", "subreddit": "science", "body": "Didn't work on me at all.\nDiapers,upset stomaches etc was pretty sure to send me out projectyle vometing", "author": "swadx001", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1768655871.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.9070361852645874, "compound_score": -0.8973, "scores": {"negative": 0.907, "neutral": 0.0832, "positive": 0.0097}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o03hl4t", "post_id": "1qfajgo", "subreddit": "science", "body": "It’s called exposure therapy, and the specific mechanisms of change are inhibitory learning and habituation.

Unlike old-school botnets, these agents coordinate in real time, adapt to feedback, and sustain coherent narratives across thousands of accounts.\n\n How AI-controlled personas work\n\nAdvances in large language models and multi-agent systems allow a single operator to deploy thousands of AI “voices” that look authentic and talk like locals. They can run millions of micro-tests to find the most persuasive messages, creating a synthetic consensus that feels grassroots-driven but is engineered to manipulate democratic discourse.\n\nDeepfakes, fake news and election warning signs\n \nFull-scale AI swarms remain theoretical, but **early warning signs include AI-generated deepfakes and fabricated news outlets that influenced recent election debates** in the U.S., Taiwan, Indonesia and India, says UBC computer scientist Dr. Kevin Leyton-Brown.\n\nMonitoring groups also report pro-Kremlin networks flooding the web with content intended to poison future AI training data.\n\nWhat experts fear may come next\n \n**AI swarms could tilt the balance of power in democracies**, said Dr. Leyton-Brown. “We shouldn’t imagine that society will remain unchanged as these systems emerge. A likely result is decreased trust of unknown voices on social media, which could empower celebrities and make it harder for grassroots messages to break through.” \n\nResearchers say the next election could be the proving ground for this technology.
