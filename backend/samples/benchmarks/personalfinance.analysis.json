In 2024, he moved to a new office. The new office told me he was still in-network with my insurance.\n\nI later had an emergency tooth extraction. Before the procedure, I was told my insurance benefits were fine. After the extraction, I was suddenly told my benefits were already maxed out and that I now owed $2,000.\n\nThe office then told me they could “do me a favor” and bill the extraction as orthodontics so insurance would pay. I explicitly said no, because I have never had orthodontic treatment. They told me if they rendered the service as-is, I would owe the $2,000.\n\nI contacted my insurance and filed a grievance. I didn’t hear back for a long time.\n\nAbout a year later, I checked my EOB and saw that my insurance had paid the dentist $2,000 for orthodontic services — services I never received. The EOB even showed a supposed orthodontic “treatment plan,” which is completely false.\n\nI immediately contacted my insurance again and filed another grievance. After investigating, insurance confirmed the office committed fraud and clawed back the $2,000 from the dentist.\n\nHowever, the dentist’s office is now threatening to send me to collections for the same $2,000, claiming if I had never rendered the service, I wouldn’t owe this. \n\nImportant details:\n\t•\tI never consented to orthodontic billing\n\t•\tI never received orthodontic services\n\t•\tInsurance confirmed fraud and recovered the money\n\t•\tThe office also lied about being in-network (I later found out the dentist was never in-network at the new location)\n\t•\tI have nearly 20 emails over the year asking the office for an itemized bill and clarification once I noticed the ortho billing — they never responded\n\t•\tI didn’t even know there was supposedly an “outstanding balance” until December, when they suddenly called and threatened collections\n\t•\tI have documentation of all emails and recorded phone calls\n\nI’m worried about my credit and whether I should:\n\t•\tPay the $2,000 just to avoid collections\n\t•\tRefuse to pay since the debt is tied to fraudulent billing\n\t•\tDispute the debt formally and wait\n\nI wish I read the reviews of this new office because they are doing it to others, I’m not alone but I feel alone.

The house is heated by propane, there is a 500 pound tank on site. On the day I closed on the house the tank was about 60% full according to the gauge on it (it shows a percentage). Propane, or any type of fuel, is not mentioned in the purchase agreement. There is language that says something like I am “purchasing the dwelling and all things within.” I was never asked about propane by anyone involved… my agent, the bank I financed with, no one.  There are no addendums or anything like that either. It was as simple as buying a place can get.\n\nOn about Dec. 23 I called the propane company whose name is on the tank and set up a new account.\n\nOn January 2 they delivered propane and topped off the tank. They then sent a bill for the about 200 gallons they gave me, and I mailed them a check and they cashed it.\n\nA few days later I get another bill from them, for 118 gallons of propane. I thought it was a mistake so I called them.\n\nNot a mistake, they said it was for the propane that was already in the tank when I bought the house and that they had refunded the previous home owner for it.  I got nowhere arguing with them about it saying they were wrong, asking how they could just do that.\n\nI know they can’t do that but what can I do? It’s like a $350 bill which is probably less than a lawyer would cost but it’s more about the principle.\n\nEdit. I think I’m just going to not do business with them. If when I had called to set up my account they would have told me everything up front that’s one thing. But to wait so long and not even address it, just send a bill, that doesn’t feel honest. I’ll do business with someone else.\n\nI see replies about leasing tanks and consumables but, as I see it, you pay for the propane when it’s delivered. That makes all of it yours, regardless of who owns the tank it’s in. Hypothetically, If I bought a propane truck and sucked everything out of my leased tank, and then returned the tank to the company empty I wouldn’t owe them anything for the propane I already bought, right? Right.\n\nThank you everyone for replying and helping me out.\n\nEdit 2. There are a lot of replies so I wanted to add and clarify things. Yes, this is Amerigas. This is my first time dealing with them or big propane tanks. I was going off memory when I originally posted, the correct quantities are:\n\nOriginal delivery: 215 gal\n\nThe bs they’re billing me for: 185 gal.\n\n$1.69/gal +\\~$45 in fees per delivery.\n\nI’ve only bought houses heated by natural gas, a consumable, you start paying on the day you take possession. I think maybe there is language like “buyer assumes all utilities as of purchase date“ 📅on one of the documents you sign or you verbally attest at closing that you’ve already put it in your name.\n\nWater is usually called out specifically, at closing they’ve always needed something from the city that says the account is current. And again, you pay from when you take possession.\n\nI do wonder how would it work with a house heated by heating oil? Is that something usually spelled out in buying process?\n\nOverall I feel like I’m getting swindled by them. What if I never called them to set up an account? I just use the tank until it’s empty and get a new company with a new tank, I put their tank to the side. When they finally come knocking I say I just moved in and the tank was empty when I got here.\n\nSomeone asked what I’d do if the tank would have been empty. That would be ideal I think, then I’d just get a delivery and not have to go through the hassle of changing companies.\n\nIf it had been talked about during the purchase process or addressed at closing I’d be fine with paying for whatever’s left when I took possession. Even if the seller reached out to me after the purchase and was like “hey, I forgot about the propane. “ I’d give him cash. Again, totally fair. If, when I called Amerigas to first setup my account they had said I needed to pay for what was in the tank then I would have paid them without issue.\n\nThey did not bill me until  they delivered on Jan. 2 and then knew how much was in the tank. I took possession like 2 months before that. See, they told me “maybe you should reach out to the seller to get your money back.”  So when did they call for their refund? Amerigas just eats the difference between when they call and I, maybe, call? I’m not buying it.\n\nI feel it was on Amerigas to say no to them when they called for their refund. Now that I’ve thought about it, I would have expected to cut a check for that propane at closing, there’s got to be a process for that but the seller would have to initiate it.\n\nHonestly, it was quite the process to get a delivery set up, I had to speak to like 4 people and it still wasn’t right. Once I got a delivery the driver gave me their number and said to just call them if I needed anything, and bypass “the office, they suck, DO NOT call them, call me.” Which was cool but didn’t give me hopes for dealing with the office. So I’d really rather just go with another company. Amerigas can have their propane and tank back. I already have another company I’m dealing with.\n\nAgain, thanks for all the input, I appreciate it.", "author": "gfddsertgv", "score": 1247, "num_comments": 344, "created_utc": 1770005859.0, "permalink": "/r/personalfinance/comments/1qtkz0m/propane_company_billed_me_for_my_own_propane_now/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1qtkz0m/propane_company_billed_me_for_my_own_propane_now/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.527646541595459, "compound_score": -0.503, "scores": {"negative": 0.5276, "neutral": 0.4477, "positive": 0.0246}}}, {"post": {"id": "1r0qoe0", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "title": "Are HYSAs as easy as I think they are?", "selftext": "I had money sitting in a normal bank account for years and it made all of $.10 a month.

I do not have family in the US, so there was no support system in place to give financial advice, particularly for US-based retirement planning/investing. A financial adviser who worked with NW Mutual connected with me on LinkedIn, and before long I was having regular meetings with him. Long story short:\n\n\\- He sold me a whole life policy at NW Mutual as a “cash diversification tool in addition to lifetime coverage”.\n\n\\- When he later moved to Guardian Life, suddenly the old policy was not good enough anymore, since apparently Guardian policy structures, PUA options and cash value growth were better. I ended up surrendering the old one and signing up for a new one with Guardian. (I know!) This was last year.\n\n\\- One year back, he also convinced me to open a brokerage account and put in a certain amount monthly. He also helped me with backdoor Roth - something I had zero idea how to do at the time. This was probably one of the only useful things he did for me, along with suggesting I max out my 401K and HSA. But as you may have guessed already, all the mutual funds bought for the Roth and brokerage accounts were American Funds with high expense ratios and 5.75% front-load fees (class A mutual funds). At the time, I was aware that these were actively managed mutual funds and so will have high ER. But I had zero idea that some mutual funds had front-load fees, so of course I didn’t know what to ask, nor was I made aware of.\n\nLuckily, I did do some things right:\n\n\\- I made sure to keep 12 months of expenses in a HYSA for emergency at all times. My “advisor” kept saying this is too much cash to keep lying around, and that 6 or even 3 months of expenses would be enough and I should invest the rest with him. I held firm because of the current job volatility in my domain.\n\n\\- I invested regularly in S&P 500 index funds in my personal brokerage account. That money is doing well and has seen steady growth over the past few years. With this too, I was frequently gaslit by my advisor, who said my portfolio was very unbalanced with too little international and medium/small-cap exposure and that it was a very risky portfolio to have. He more than once indicated I let him transfer the whole portfolio to his managed brokerage account, where he could sell off the funds and build a more “balanced portfolio” (and line his pockets with more front-load fees, of course). Thankfully, I held firm on this too, because I wanted at least one part of my investments to be fully in my control (and have since started adding international index funds to my portfolio as well).\n\nCut to this year, I stumbled on some WL policy related posts on Reddit that set off alarm bells. The more I read, the more it made sense not to have almost 10% of my monthly paycheck go into a policy for lifetime coverage when all I needed was coverage for the next 25-30 years - at which point my savings/retirement accounts will have grown enough to cover any dependents. The opportunity cost I was losing now was so much! I had also started wondering why my brokerage investments were not growing at par with the growth of the mutual funds themselves and this is how I discovered the front-load fees. Interestingly, the account statements do not show the actual amount that gets invested. So if you put in 100$, the statement shows 100$ was invested in a certain fund and not the actual amount of 94.25$. Then in very tiny font somewhere else, you will have the caveat about front-load fees buried alongside other text, making it hard to find if you don’t know what you’re looking for. \n\nThis is where I started talking to family members and family friends, did more research on my own and realized I was getting fleeced. I immediately surrendered my WL policy (lost a few thousand dollars since I’m in the early years of the policy - but no use throwing good money after bad), stopped the brokerage transfers and transferred the positions to my personal brokerage (haven’t decided what to do with them yet but I just wanted out). But I still want to kick myself in the foot sometimes for having been so naive as to let someone else (an insurance agent nonetheless) handle my own money. Looking back, I think it was my own insecurities about handling finances, combined with the lack of a good support system that managed to keep the wool over my eyes for the past few years. I recently got married and my husband has been managing his own finances for a long time, this also gave me the confidence to take back control of my money. \n\nTo be clear, I’m not saying this is a scam. You may genuinely have life circumstances where you need WL policy. And if you do not have the time/inclination to manage your own finances, having a financial advisor do that for you might be better than doing no saving/investing at all. Just be aware that with a few hours/days of research and simple one-time automatic setups, you can have so much more growth that you are losing out on in upfront fees, and in a lot of cases, useless insurance premiums.

Right now the implied open has him at an estimated $75k loss.   \n  \n\nany thoughts, ideas, advice? \n\n**Edit:** prevailing question is how is it possible that Vanguard is extending $3M in margin without the customer knowing and how is it possible that there is not some extra pop up or big red warning. It would be a pretty peculiar strategy to make use of margin for the first time ever at $2.7m over a 3 day holiday weekend on a small cap ETF. He signed up for the account a decade ago and does not recall ever requesting or approving margin trading but does not discount that it is possible he did as part of the original onboarding. \n\nSome more context. He transferred in $10k of cash, then made what he thought was a **$10k** purchase of **VB** - instead inadvertently made a **10k share** purchase at **$276** a share equaling **$2.76 million** in margin.\n  \nWe are talking about maybe seeing if he can put an options collar around his position to mitigate loss and wait for the stock to recover as it looks like the market might be a shit show at open around tariff fears and EU retaliation. What a mess. But he cannot get anyone from Vanguard to discuss. As liquidation is a real threat and then that would trigger all kinds of crazy tax implications for him. Most likely option is selling at limit at open and trying to set the limit at a few cents under expected open. \n    \n**If you know anyone from Vanguard reach out to me :)**\n  \n**Update** he got a hold of his independent financial advisors and they too think this is crazy. They advised against any hedges based on complexity, risk and timing. They are advising him to try to contact Vanguard ASAP in the morning and get out of the trade quickly and orderly with maybe assistance from Vanguard. \n  \nThey did say that they would not put it passed VG to have potentially effed up on his margin status but to worry about that after the fact. \n\nOh, and it was $3.7M! There was another $1M in a different position other than VB. \n  \nCrazy.\n\n**Update 2**   Mods locked the thread. I’ll update here with the outcome still. He spoke to his financial advisor again. Plan is still to sell at open but he confirmed his account does not have margin enabled and the trade was classified as “cash” in the transaction statement. He is going to try to contact VG at 8am when their support opens.\n\n**Update 3** $37k loss to get out of the position. He is working with a relationship manager who was very sympathetic and agreed that something does not seem right and is working to get clarity and next steps. This morning he could not get anywhere with L1 support as somehow the trade went through without it being classified as margin so the margin group would not talk to him.\n  \nBottom line is they are classifying this as a good faith trade with the implication that cash to cover was on its way in but not calling it margin. Which on face value sounds a lot like margin to me, yet without any required disclosures or opt in requirements. \n  \nAlso, they let him close out of the position without cash coming in which essentially was a free ride, which is contradictory to their stated policies. One would think that without specifically opting in that it would not be possible to make a $3.7m trade not covered by your cash holdings.

I have copies of the EOB showing the orthodontic billing, documentation that insurance paid the office $2,000, the two grievances I filed, and records confirming I never received orthodontic services. I also have documented emails to the office begging for additional information about the ortho code. \n\nI assumed that once fraud was confirmed, there would be additional consequences beyond simply recovering the money. Right now, it feels like the insurer is getting reimbursed, and that’s, that.

FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS BABY JESUS—>Remember that there are only TWO sure sure things in life:  Death and Taxes\n\n1.  It’s good practice to start early in paying the man (although you’re probably not eating enough to be “paying” yet)\n\n2.  If you earn over $15,500 (may be $15,750), you MUST file a tax return**a.   *W-2*\n\n3.  If you are “Self-Employeed” (DoorDash, Uber, Instacart, House Sitting, Dog Walking) AND earn over $400 you MUST file a tax return**b.   *1099*\n\n4.  If Mom/Dad/Nana/Poppop set up a savings or investment account in your name OR you have same said account in your name, you MUST file a tax return (unearned income) *1099DIV*  *1099INT* etc\n\n5.  Mom and Dad CAN claim you on THEIR return until you turn 24 while you are living at home. On your return, you must select “can someone else claim me as a dependent.”\n\n**a.  You will get this form from your employer and file accordingly via a tax service/online software. I suggest that you use someone other than your parents to help you since they’re already going you bad advice.  FreeTaxUSA is actually free in most cases.\n\nALSO—>Even if your income is NOT about $15,750 on your W-2 from your employer for the year, FILE ANYWAY!!!  You are entitled to the entire amount of federal withholding by your employer, if any. REFUND!!\n\n**b.  Get in the habit of reporting all income. Cash from side jobs like house sitting, dog walking, etc.  If you wind up being self-employed down the road and your business does some cash in the business and it’s not properly reported yet shows up as going in and out of your bank account, this will be an issue when you go to purchase a home…even though your credit may be stellar and income strong. Plus, income is taxable and it’s the law. It sucks and he .001% screw all of us, but we’re also the ones that get in the most trouble if caught. \n\nIf you’re earning money on social media and it totals over $400, that gets reported to the IRS. Be careful; Sometimes companies don’t start issuing 1099 forms until you earn more than XXXX dollars, like $1500 in a 12 month period. Pay attention to that little nugget. \n\n\nSoooo moral of the story, file your taxes if you’re earning income.

That is illegal. Guardian and NWM policies are close enough and won’t have that different of a dividend. But the kicker is you had the NWM policy for many years, meaning by the time you got the guardian policy, you were older and the cost of the insurance was higher. I am assuming you did a 1035 exchange? \n\nI sell life insurance and whole life, but putting 10% of your income in a whole life policy is criminal from that advisor. Honestly, I don’t even say the words “whole life” with any clients unless they make a minimum of $250k and realistically $400k. The benefits just are not worth it until you are making that much money. And even then, I have found that it’s less than optimal to use much more than 5% gross income to wl.\n\nHere is exactly what the advisor was doing. Even though it appears they are investment licensed as an investment advisor representative and are required to act as a fiduciary when talking about investments, when they are talking about life insurance products, they are not held to the same fiduciary standard. By fiduciary standard, all of the recommendations they make have to be in the best interest of the client. But when acting as an insurance agent, they only have to achieve a suitability standard. In theory, this means that an insurance advisor can recommend products that do offer you a suitable amount of benefit based on the particular circumstances of what you have going on. But that doesn’t mean that what they are advising you is actually in your best interest or other recommendations, products, or vehicles might actually serve you better. The confusing thing is that advisors with both sets of credentials can switch back and forth. \n\nWith this agent, he worked for NWM for x years. The compensation structure there is a commission for life products sold that year. Then every year you get a renewal bonus based on a percentage of the total amount of premium you have in the books. So if you sold a wl policy for $10k of premium, you are likely making a commission in that year of $4-5k. Then the following year you would make a couple hundred dollars off if that policy as a renewal bonus if your client keeps it in force. So if you are able to consistently sell a lot of policies every year, after 5-10 years, your renewals are going to be significant and a stable income stream on their own. There are compensation formulas that these companies have where if you have a lot of policies that people lapse, your renewal compensation gets lowered across the board. So in theory this incentivizes agents to only write whole life policies if they know they are actually appropriate because if you are just focused on the year one commissions, your renewal compensation will suffer as these clients realize they made a mistake. \n\nGuardian in particular has the most favorable renewal payout rates to their agents. NWM is a meat locker that is really good at recruiting people strait out of college to come and work for them. Guardian snatches agents from them with their attractive contract and the renewal rates. What your agent did was they looked at how much their renewals were at NWM and saw how much they typically sell per year. Then they did the math and figured how long it would take them to reach that and surpass it if they switched to guardian. So they switched because it’s a no brainer. As a result your original policy was no longer providing renewal income to the agent because he left NWM and joined guardian. But by having you surrender your NWM policy and replace it with guardian, he is making renewals again. Not only that, but you were older, so the initial premium in year one was higher for them. So they are having their cake and eating it too. Replacing insurance products like this is illegal because life insurance is priced on mortality and the fees associated with these policies are front loaded. By replacing the policy, your premium is likely higher and the internal growth has to start over slowly because their commission for year one has to be paid. Guardian and NWM have similar products with similar performance. Not sure what he did to justify the replacement in the paperwork. Probably used a slightly different policy design or added a different rider like long term care. Not saying this is good or bad, but replacing mutual WL with Mutual WL is typically close to a wash unless the underlying company is starting to struggle or demutualize. \n\nI will also caution that just because an advisor may be a fiduciary doesn’t mean that they are always acting in your best interest too. There is a lot of grey area here. For example, you can find all sorts of studies and data that says timing the market is terrible and usually causes you to lose compared to staying invested long term. If you are an advisor and a client comes to you and says, “I think the market is going to crash, sell everything and put it in cash until things smooth out.” What do you do? Do you listen to the client? Their want for cash and security is a legitimate fear and worry. The studies and data are valid that this will likely not work out for them. So you advise them that they shouldn’t move to cash. But then they hit you with “move it to cash or I’ll take my money to a different advisor.” That’s where it gets grey. If you move them to cash, you technically are acting justified based on the rules for a fiduciary because that is what you client is wanting to do. But that is not in their best interest. \n\nAnother is when there is a stock that has done very well recently and a client tells their advisor something like, “my cousin has this in their portfolio, it has gone up 200%. I want you to put that in my portfolio.” This is chasing returns. Odds are it will not keep going up and chasing it will cause you to lose gains elsewhere. Plus this transaction is going to create tax drag. The advisor should explain both of these things to the client and explain why the portfolio is structured the way it is. But then they hit back with, “buy this or I’m moving my money to another advisor.” If the advisor caves, I don’t know how you can say they are acting in the client’s best interest. \n\nAdvisors should act in the best interest of their clients always regardless of which role they are acting in. And this means letting clients go who don’t take their advice.  I Also think more should be done regulation wise to separate insurance agents from investment advisors in their clients eyes because you have a lot of agents like op has and they make it harder for people like me who do treat everyone from a best interest standpoint at all times. My mindset is that if I am going to fail, it’s not because I didnt over sell you a product that wasn’t in your best interest.

I promise you, 99 out of 100 times, no teller cares you’re doing a $70k cash deposit. Yes, they have to ask questions, but those questions rarely turn up anything suspicious. If you try to skirt around the rules, that’s when it becomes suspicious and they begin filing additional forms.\n\nJust go in, hand them the $70k cash, ask to deposit, and if they ask where it came from, you just answer truthfully. You lent your brother $70k, he paid you it back in full as cash. Just straightforward.\n\nAs for the IRS. This is a massive misconception regarding banks. When you deposit $10k+, tellers are required to file a CTR. This CTR does NOT go to the IRS. It’s a form filed that becomes attached to your file and remains there. The bank doesn’t send it in to the IRS, and it doesn’t trigger anything for the IRS.\n\nIf you begin trying to manipulate the rules, then the bank may files UARs, or SARs. These suspicious activities do get escalated, and if the bank has reasonable suspicion, then they’ll send a suspicious activity report to the IRS. That’s when the IRS will investigate and they’ll ask the bank for CTRs and all other relevant information. Again, all this is triggered because someone attempted to skirt the rules.\n\nSo just do it the correct way, that easy.\n\nEDIT: I saw some of the FinCEN comments. OP was asking about IRS. FinCEN and IRS are separate agencies. Yes, a CTR is federally required to be submitted to FinCEN as well, however, the outcome does not change. FinCEN receives millions of CTRs each year, and this single CTR becomes a single data point in a massive database. FinCEN stores all this data, but does literally nothing with it aside from making fancy data trends. No human is performing any manual checks on all CTRs coming in. It's only when a UAR/SAR is submitted that things begin moving. UARs/SARs are scored, and if the risk scoring is high, then a manual review begins. That's when you start worrying about audits.

So in your case, you currently make $130K annually, and 85% of that would be $110,500 annually. If you wanted to make that much in retirement your current balance would need to be approximately $390K. Right now you have approximately $174K saved for retirement. If we run a similar calculation, we can estimate that you are currently on track to have an annual income of approximately $58,000 when you retire. So now the bigger question is something you need to assess personally. Can you survive and live the retirement you want to live on an income of $58K annually? If you can, then great you are on track! If not, then you need to find ways to save more. Whether that means cutting back on your current lifestyle to contribute more, working more, making more, delaying your retirement, etc. \n\nEven at your current age, every extra bit that you can squirrel away now will make a big impact down the road. Based on your current income, increasing your retirement contributions by just 1% now will compound into an extra $75K in retirement savings by age 65 assuming a conservative 7% growth. The general rule of thumb is that you should try to save no less than 15% of your annual salary towards retirement.

I haven't done detailed modeling, but I expect this would more or less put you on track.  If you could do it in 1-3 years, even better.\n\nOption two is to increase income by about 5% and invest it.  This could be you or your wife picking up a few hours somewhere to bring in an extra $5-10k/yr that you can invest.\n\nOption three is to assess retirement spending.  Are your costs in retirement likely to decrease?  Kids will be out of the house.  Maybe a mortgage paid off?  If you expect to spend 20-35% less in retirement than you are today, you may well already be on track.\n\nThese are not your only options, but they're a good starting point.\n\nRegardless of your exact strategy, with large raises, at least initially, I would recommend diverting 50% of the raise to investing.

RSUs are the most common type of restricted awards, but we do see RSAs occasionally. \n\nWhen your awards are *unvested*, they do not belong to you. They haven't even been issued by the transfer agent at this point, so those shares don't even exist when they are unvested.\n\nThen, awards *vest*. You pay taxes on those shares, which gives you a cost basis (since you didn't buy the shares on the open market), they are issued by the transfer agent, deposited into your brokerage account, and you become the owner of those shares.\n\nVery occasionally there are what are called \"clawback\" provisions, but those are generally triggered soon after separation of service or termination of employment.\n\nBased on your description, you most likely had RSUs with no clawback provision, which is quite common. There are occasionally transfer or sale restriction timeframes, which you can reach out to your brokerage firm to confirm.\n\nBut aside from holding periods, those shares are much like any other shares. You can sell them, hold them, or transfer them.\n\nShould you sell them while they are with the original broker in the original account, you will be provided a supplemental 1099 with all the adjusted cost basis contained.

You need to understand that when your parents setup these accounts, index funds did not exist. There were no investment options with extremely low fees (basically free) like there are today. There were no avenues to free investing at all, you even had to pay a trade commission for every purchase or sale of individual stocks. That’s why your parents chose these funds back then, mutual funds were the low cost option at the time. You also need to ask what share class you own. Advisors have access to advisory shares that have much lower fees than you can get on your own. There are also shares where most of the fees are paid up front and then have minimal fees ongoing, and eventually go to 0 when the account gets big enough. So just ask, as you might be in a class where you are paying no fees at this point.\n\nUltimately, you need to decide on whether or not you need any help navigating investments, or more importantly, the trust that this is sitting in. If not, just distribute the funds to a personal brokerage and manage everything on your own using index funds.", "author": "hems86", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1770761736.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.6531347632408142, "compound_score": -0.2944, "scores": {"negative": 0.3206, "neutral": 0.6531, "positive": 0.0262}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4xs1bx", "post_id": "1r2kvuy", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "body": "Botox for Migraines has a savings program to reimburse for any out of pocket cost associated with treatment up to $5,000 annually. \n\nhttps://www.botoxsavingsprogram.com/ChronicMigraine", "author": "tea_low", "score": 1248, "created_utc": 1770876578.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8115143775939941, "compound_score": 0.1068, "scores": {"negative": 0.0409, "neutral": 0.8115, "positive": 0.1476}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4yx2vk", "post_id": "1r2kvuy", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "body": "This.
