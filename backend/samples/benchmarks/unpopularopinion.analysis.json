Yes, it’s experimental, and in concept, interesting. I know the film is trying to explore human evolution, mortality, technology, and the cosmic scale of existence, and philosophically, the ideas are enormous and interesting. I respect the ambition. What I don't respect is the execution. Ambition alone doesn’t make a good film; execution matters.\n\nFor the record, I love stories that are heavy, philosophical, and meta. But the ones I admire integrate their philosophy and existential themes through characters, conflict, and the world itself, not just through atmosphere or visuals. They slow down when necessary, but the slowdown is always earned emotionally or narratively.\n\n2001, by contrast, utterly fails to execute its ambitious themes. Instead it's a freaking screensaver half the time. I admire the cinematography, but it feels like it consistently sacrifices pacing for spectacle: 2/3rds of the middle act is shots of spaceships drifting through space\n\nDialogue is minimal, character stakes are nonexistent, narrative momentum is nearly absent. The film wants to asks us to contemplate cosmic evolution and human insignificance, and yet it never gives us anything human to anchor those ideas to. The philosophy is presented as spectacle rather than lived experience.\n\nEven the ending, with the Stargate and the Star Child, is visually impressive but narratively and emotionally hollow. It gestures at transcendence, but without a character’s struggle or internalization. And by the end, the ideas are nothing more than meaningless, underexplored, abstracts floating in a vacuum, interesting in theory, but completely ungrounded\n\nI’m not dismissing the concepts themselves. They’re enormous, fascinating, and deserve exploration. But 2001’s execution absolutely ruined them. Being experimental and meditative doesn’t automatically create meaningful philosophy, the ideas have to emerge through story, characters, and conflict. Without that, all you have is floating ships, classical music, and a screensaver middle act.\n\nI respect what Kubrick was trying to do, but I also really believe he messed up big time. I genuinely don't see how people say this is the greatest movie of all time. The film is ambitious but emotionally lifeless, visually interesting but narratively inert, and philosophically gestural rather than impactful. Execution matters, and on that front, this movie is a failure\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to make clear I can definitely acknowledge the good aspects of the film on a cinematic level, especially the visuals, composition, and technical innovation, it’s genuinely beautiful to look at, and I never knew the film broke so much ground with some of these techniques\n\nThat said, in my opinion, there is still some big flaws in execution. I genuinely feel like objectively, the film failed to live up to the book’s narrative and philosophical weight. The book actually explores those ideas and concepts in a way that feels lived and intelligible, whereas the movie often sacrifices that depth for spectacle. A lot of the philosophical and meta themes never really land because they’re abstracted into visuals rather than experienced through characters or narrative. On top of that, the pacing is just brutal.\n\nTL;DR In my opinion, the film falters in translating the book’s ideas into something as intellectually and emotionally substantial", "author": "KaihakuOkami", "score": 632, "num_comments": 330, "created_utc": 1770889399.0, "permalink": "/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1r2p8ti/2001_a_space_odyssey_isnt_a_good_film/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1r2p8ti/2001_a_space_odyssey_isnt_a_good_film/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.4744494557380676, "compound_score": -0.3587, "scores": {"negative": 0.4744, "neutral": 0.4098, "positive": 0.1158}}}, {"post": {"id": "1r33g4a", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "title": "Unflavored Tortilla Chips Are Better Than \"Hint of Lime\" I ain't playin", "selftext": "When the hint of lime chips first came out they were very fun - now when I go to a gathering with chips and salsa I find myself longing for the comfort of plain tortilla chips.

You get a backlight to read at night, you can carry hundreds of books with you, you can easily get comfortable with it, if you have a waterproof reader you can read in the bathtub, or hot tub or pool or where-ever you want to relax. etc. But I think one of the biggest, unspoken things that makes it a better experience, is not having a stack of physical pages as a visual indicator of how much you have left. For me, I feel a book is an investment, I'm taking a chance on investing a significant amount of time into it, the bigger the book, the more of an investment. It's much harder for me to settle in and get serious about it if I'm overwhelmed with it before I've even started. Not being able to see or feel that, makes it feel much less like an investment. Its much easy to open a book start reading, and keep reading based on how I actually feel about it, and there's no real feeling of being overwhelmed by the size of the book.

They are revolutionary, and without them, many modern movies wouldn't even exist. If I had been around when these movies were originally released, I probably would have loved them all too, since there was nothing like them back then\n\nHowever, even though I respect everyone's opinions and all, I disagree with people who say this is still one of the best trilogies of all time... now, let's get the easy one out of the way first. I think The Empire Strikes Back is still great today. It holds up better than I thought it would. I admittedly don't quite love it as much as some of you do, but I still really enjoyed it for the most part.\n\nHowever, I can't be the only one who thinks the other two aren't nearly as good? A New Hope, in particular, aged the worst in my opinion. The story is extremely basic and simplistic, the characters are pretty generic and stereotypical, the pacing is rather slow, and the action is not very exciting... Again, I acknowledge how important it was, and how it certainly must not have felt so basic and cliched back then, but I don't think it holds up that well on rewatch. It also doesn't connect that well with its sequels. When ANH was made, it was apparently planned to be a standalone movie, only after its success were sequels planned. As long as you've seen it once, it's a very easy movie to skip on rewatches... You can just jump into Empire, and almost everything makes sense.\n\nAs for Return of the Jedi, I think people only look back fondly on this one because it nailed the ending. If they hadn't nailed the ending, people would be a lot more critical of the rest of the movie too. For me, the rest of the movie isn't that great. Now, I don't hate the Ewoks, and I understand a lot of people really like them now, but admittedly, these parts are pretty boring. The pacing in general is just off; it doesn't feel anywhere near as consistent as Empire. The action is solid, but I actually think Empire had better action, which may be an unpopular opinion of its own.   \n  \nWhen most people look back on ROTJ, chances are they mostly remember the Throne room scenes and Vader's redemption. And, while these are easily the best scenes in the movie, I noticed they are a bit repetitive... like, every time we cut back to the Throne room, it's just Palpatine saying the same thing to Luke with different wording. It's still cool, but it's also not as legendary as I thought (the part with Vader's redemption is really good tho). Combine that with the rest of the movie being far below the level of Empire, and you get a movie that is good, but in my opinion, not great.\n\nSo, based on this, I really can't see the Star Wars OT as a great trilogy nowadays, when the only installment that I believe lives up to that anymore is Empire. It's not like something like LOTR, where each of the 3 movies is individually great and has plenty of memorable moments and things to offer. If I wanted to do a rewatch of LOTR, I would definitely see all 3. If I wanted to rewatch Star Wars, I would just see Empire (and Revenge of the Sith, but this post is about the OT).", "author": "NamelessGamer_1", "score": 0, "num_comments": 53, "created_utc": 1770557946.0, "permalink": "/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1qz95mj/the_star_wars_original_trilogy_doesnt_hold_up/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1qz95mj/the_star_wars_original_trilogy_doesnt_hold_up/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.41780951619148254, "compound_score": -0.201, "scores": {"negative": 0.4178, "neutral": 0.3654, "positive": 0.2168}}}], "comments": [{"comment": {"id": "o49nwl0", "post_id": "1qzcbv0", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "body": "Please remember what subreddit you are in, this is unpopular opinion.

We had McDonalds for lunch.  We *did* eat at a nice place in Edinburgh, Scotland when we went there for a long weekend, but we didn't eat haggis.  Sometimes 'authentic' is just a bit much.\n\nSpeaking of...:\n\nYou travel enough and you might not want to see much \"authenticity\" any more.\n\n>People are the same everywhere.\n\nI put 'traditional' and \"authenticity\" like that for a reason.\n\nMost places, most average people, the really authentic ones....  They eat some proteins and carbs for most meals.  Meat and potatoes...chicken, fish, rice, pasta...etc.  They work for a living, and aren't able to afford to go to all the \"authentic\" foody places for every meal, and might dislike it just as much as foreigners would.  The authentic people don't care about the museums, sights to see, historical monuments, etc etc.  The authentic people are just living their life like people everywhere else are.  Authentic is often very boring.\n\nFor people going on a real vacation wanting a change of pace, they frequently *want* the stereotype, not authenticity, they *want* the touristy things because those are what we see in media, the things we can't do or even approximate where we're at.  And when you go home, and you haven't done the token tourist things, \"Did you see the.....Did you have a slice of....\" and you say \"Nah, we went into the inner city and stayed at a BnB and got to meet this nice family and....\" And the people listening to you are snoozing or annoyed.

Each section is about 35 minutes and you have logical reasoning, the example question OP references, reading comprehension, and logic games. The LSAT doesn't just test logical reasoning, but very very much tests you're ability to think and read quickly as you will absolutely be crunched for time. That's the challenge of the LSAT. This does not translate to the real world. In the real world you have much more complicated facts along with way more time to analyze and try and figure it whatever problem you're dealing with.\n\nAdd to that, that what people probably don't understand is that the LSAT is the biggest determinant in what law school you go to (yes you have grades and character essays, but the LSAT is huge), which is hugely determinant on what outcomes you might have leaving law school. When you're going to law school you typically take on a ton of student debt. So, going to the best law school ensures you have the best chance at getting to a high paying big law job/prestigious job, which allows you to pay down your debt quickly because if you don't you could be stuck with that debt for a long time. So, not only is the LSAT difficult, but its also hugely determinant on your future. So there's a ton of pressure that comes along with anyone taking it to actually place into law school and is very very stressful.\n\nI could understand people exposing themselves to some logical reasoning questions just to familiarize yourself with the logic. Reading comprehension? Just read more books/difficult articles. Do you really need to take time out of your day to test yourself? No. Logic games? Trust me they are incredibly formulaic and you can basically just teach yourself a system to answer each type of question. Just gotta be able to apply it when you're crunched for time, which is tough and does not translate to the real world. And the scenarios for logic games rarely come up in real life (the last time it was useful was during an escape room).\n\nDon't bother with taking the LSAT. Even if you're not trying to get into law school, don't bother with the prep and stress.

Income is what flows in whereas wealth is what stay to compound. Ppl can have a high salary like ur friend but still be financially exposed if for every raise, they turn it into a lifestyle upgrade instead of investing it and build security\n\nLiving within our means isnt enough if everything gets consumed. If nothing compounds, then how are we expect to create optionality? Wealth is what gives ppl flexibility: the ability to pause, pivot careers etc\n\nHigh earners often underestimate difficulty of building capital. They say “I make 300k, I can probably save 300k in a few years, easy” But what often happen is constant upgrades which eats the surplus fast. Earning more creates opportunity for wealth, but with no discipline, it just fuels a more expensive life\n\nPeople also forget careers hv peak windows and we're not always healthy. If our lifestyle rises to match our highest earning years, what happens when income slow down? Lifestyle creep is easy on the way up, but on the way down.? Without assets and savings, a dip in income means stress, debt, or feeling trapped, it's not just tightening our budget \n\nIts ok to enjoy high income years, but never mistake them for permanence. Build wealth while the window is open, so lifestyle doesnt depend on staying at our peak forever. \n\nAlso a lot of young ppl are obsessed with appearing rich. I get it, its easy, its visible. But it's a trap to make them poor forever. Wealth doesnt really have a look. It sits in investments, equity and assets that dont announce themselves. Rich is a lifestyle signal, wealth is quiet ownership. So the real question is. What are these ppl actually trying to signal? To who? Is it that important to show people we're doing better than them?

I know because I used to be that way until Covid snapped me out of it. I took for granted all the opportunities I had because I was scared it wouldn’t be for me or I wouldn’t make friends.\n\nPart of coming of age to me is learning to make fun and adventure out of whatever you’re doing with the company you have.

Rabbits take awhile to grow to size when compared to Chickens and have much less yield. They also have longer gestations so the process is actually slower than chickens (who basically have been bred to breed constantly).\n\n2. Rabbits have a incredibly low meat yield: there's lots of bones and aside from the rear legs (which are *about* as big as a smallish chicken leg and thigh) they don't have a very large primal cut. Their tenderloins are pretty small compared to anything else we eat regularly, and they have no breast meat to speak of compared to a duck or chicken.\n\n3. Nutritionally they are *terrible* for us. You can actually die from eating just rabbit meat (fat is very important for humans). We'd have to artificially add it after butchery or change our meal prep to include the missing fat such as eating the fatty organs like the liver.\n\n4. They are more expensive than chickens to raise because they need proper fodder to grow healthy including fresh grass and are harder to raise in cages without succumbing to disease.\n\n5. Butchering them is a chore. They have tiny bones that break easily and with no major primals, there's a lot of \"bone cuts\" where you just can't separate the meat from the bone for easy serving.\n\nBasically because of every possible reason available, most of the world swapped over to chickens from raising rabbits. At one time the US did raise a ton of rabbits, but we were able to engineer much better chickens (those massive breasts are not natural: they were bred into the chicken).

It is a way that employers keep leverage over workers because if you could say no, then they would have to panic and hire other people and might have to offer better work conditions. Instead, making employment scarce keeps people compliant and also ensures they control the terms of employment. Plus, uncertainty is passed of to you, the employee, and the shareholders get rewarded for the company not needing to hire an additional worker or schedule another shift. On the opposite end, you also have a lot of positions that are “salaried” but which really should be hourly.

And that’s totally fine. But calling it a bad movie feels more like “this isn’t my thing” than it actually being poorly made. It’s kind of like someone in this thread said, calling The Exorcist a bad movie just because you don’t like horror. That doesn’t really make it bad. It just means it’s not your genre.\n\nBecause the thing about 2001 is that it’s incredibly consistent. It sets out to do a very specific thing, and it does that thing extremely well. It’s deliberately grounded. Almost clinical. Nothing is over dramatized. It’s not trying to manipulate you emotionally in obvious ways. It’s showing you events as they unfold, almost like a nature documentary, and that applies to both the apes at the beginning and the astronauts later.\n\nWe spend time with the apes for a reason. We’re watching tribal dynamics, power structures, survival. Then the monolith shows up and completely shifts that balance. One of them touches it, and suddenly there’s a leap in abstract thought and they understand how a bone can be a tool and a weapon. That’s a seismic evolutionary shift. And Kubrick visually cements that with one of the greatest cuts in film history: the bone thrown into the air match cutting to the spacecraft. The bone was cutting edge technology of its time. Now we’re in the future looking at the new cutting edge. That’s good storytelling.\n\nAnd everything after that follows the same philosophy. The astronauts aren’t dramatized heroes. They’re professionals doing their jobs. The downtime, the routine, the mundane conversations, that’s intentional. In real life, especially in highly technical environments, there is a lot of routine. They’re cogs in a machine and that’s part of the point. The tone and logic is consistent. It’s restrained by design.\n\nI also don’t really buy the “no stakes” argument. There’s clear mystery and tension. The monolith on the moon is being covered up. There’s something ancient and unknown influencing human evolution. We don’t get all the answers spoon fed to us, but that doesn’t mean the stakes aren’t there. Then the Jupiter mission becomes this slow burn where HAL gradually reveals something is wrong. And when it escalates, it escalates hard.\n\nHAL literally kills a crew member and attempts to kill the other. Dave has to launch himself through the vacuum of space to get back on the ship. That’s not low stakes. And the scene where he disconnects HAL is one of the most emotionally powerful moments in the film. It forces you to ask whether he’s just shutting down a computer or killing something that might be conscious. Is HAL the next step in evolution? Is humanity destroying its successor? There’s real tension and emotion there.\n\nAs for the ending , yeah, it’s confusing, especially the first time. But confusing doesn’t mean hollow. Kubrick later explained it pretty directly: Bowman is taken through the Stargate by advanced beings and basically being kept in an alien zoo. He is observed, transformed, and returned as the Star Child, the next evolutionary leap, just like the ape with the bone. It’s abstract, but it’s thematically consistent from beginning to end. The aliens guide evolution on our planet from the shadows. That throughline is solid.\n\nAnd I think part of what makes the film powerful is that it is meditative. It gives you time to sit with ideas instead of rushing you along. That doesn’t work for everyone. Not all slow films work for me either. For example, I liked Stalker and its philosophical conversations, but I remember feeling frustrated with some apparent inconsistencies in how dangerous “the Zone” was supposed to be. It felt like the rules were stated very clearly and then occasionally not enforced. That pulled me out a bit. But even there, I appreciated what it was aiming for.\nWith 2001, though, I don’t feel those cracks. It’s slow, yes. It’s restrained. But it’s coherent, intentional, and incredibly disciplined. It’s doing something only cinema can do, expressing philosophy visually and structurally instead of through exposition.\n\nAnd honestly, I think modern media has conditioned us differently. We’re used to faster pacing, constant dialogue, explicit stakes, clear character arcs. 2001 predates that rhythm. It asks you to be patient, to observe, and to contemplate. That’s harder to vibe with today, but that doesn’t make it a failure.\n\nIt just makes it a very specific kind of film.", "author": "Brad12d3", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1770903215.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.6678261756896973, "compound_score": -0.6397, "scores": {"negative": 0.6678, "neutral": 0.304, "positive": 0.0281}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o50bs7u", "post_id": "1r2p8ti", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "body": "We as a society really gotta learn \"I don't like\" =/= \"it is bad\"", "author": "Individual-Rip-2366", "score": 21, "created_utc": 1770915170.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.8582234382629395, "compound_score": -0.85, "scores": {"negative": 0.8582, "neutral": 0.1335, "positive": 0.0083}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4yinls", "post_id": "1r2p8ti", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "body": "See it in 70mm film on a huge movie theater screen in surround sound and it’s a whole different experience than watching at home.

Human drama unfolds quickly. Evolution does not. The long shots of spacecraft docking or silent lunar landscapes are not filler. They recalibrate the audience to geological and astronomical time.

Critical theory is applied to everything. Feminism, Marxism, gender theory, queer theory, intersectionality, and the like are all that is taught. Your academic and professional career depend on becoming \"woke\" at university. \n\nI believe it is due to a sophisticated exploitation of the biological and psychological imperatives of young adults. By leveraging the human drives for social status, tribal belonging, and reproductive fitness, neo Marxist frameworks have transformed the university from a center of independent, critical thinking to a place where conformity to the orthodoxy is the primary concern of students. The result is a generation of graduates who prioritize approval over objective truth, making them easily controlled by whatever institution holds the power to socially reward or punish them.\n\nHumans are hardwired to seek social status, particularly during the peak reproductive years of early adulthood in a campus environment, virtue signaling acts as a high value fitness signal. By adopting the specialized language of neo Marxism, concepts like intersectionality, systemic privilege, and equity, students signal their intelligence, their compassion, and most importantly their alignment with the dominant tribe. To dissent is to risk social ostracization which, in a biological context, is perceived as a catastrophic threat to one's mating prospects and social safety net.\n\nThe liberal arts have largely transitioned to subjective, theory based evaluation. This shift provides the necessary enforcement mechanism for ideological conformity. When grades are determined by how well a student applies a specific critical lens rather than their ability to reason independently, the student is conditioned to associate ideological compliance with professional survival. This creates a \"spiral of silence\" where the psychological cost of intellectual honesty: academic failure and peer rejection, becomes too high for most people to accept.\n\nIts what philosopher Herbert Marcuse termed \"repressive tolerance,\" a practice of being intolerant toward traditional or conservative views while permitting any degree of radical leftist expression. This hijacks the human tribal instinct by creating a clear us versus them dichotomy. By moralizing political disagreements, activists frame dissenters as oppressors, triggering an ancient biological response to purge the out group for the safety of the tribe. Young people, whose prefrontal cortexes are still developing, are particularly susceptible to this type of emotional contagion and groupthink.\n\nIt is a system of social mechanisms designed to bypass the rational mind and speak directly to our primitive drives. By controlling the social and academic rewards of the university, neo Marxists have ensured that the path of least resistance for a young person, biologically, socially, and professionally, is total ideological submission. The result is a generation of graduates who have been trained to prioritize group conformity over the pursuit of objective truth.\n\nIt gives young people a clear mission to deconstruct traditional structures which satisfies the youthful desire to rebel against the previous generation. While also allowing those who conform to the ideology to achieve a form of social status typically reserved for older people who have achieved professional success, amassed wealth, property, etc. Its a social short cut.\n\nThis, combined with an increasingly online lifestyle, divorced from the real world, and driven by social media where likes deliver dopamine hits and which rewards and reinforces ideological conformity, have led to a generation of young people who struggle with critical thinking, who are wholly consumed by ideology, are uninterested in exploring alternative viewpoints, and who have incorporated that ideology into their personality to such a degree that any challenge to their beliefs is seen as a personal attack.", "author": "Goatmommy", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1770694236.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.8015528917312622, "compound_score": -0.7905, "scores": {"negative": 0.8016, "neutral": 0.1874, "positive": 0.0111}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4kn6tn", "post_id": "1r0ojp7", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "body": "As a pure mathematician I completely agree. \nI got into maths for a love for it, \nI find it extremely strange that people just go to uni for the money, Im sure 3+ years ahead in the jop market is going to get you on par with your peers who went to uni. \nFor most carriers creating a portfolio /experience is much more important. \n\nThis is knowledge and experience I chose, not for some financial gain but for the gain in what it is in itself", "author": "neb12345", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1770705130.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.45935139060020447, "compound_score": 0.1585, "scores": {"negative": 0.1911, "neutral": 0.4594, "positive": 0.3496}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4jqxwv", "post_id": "1r0ojp7", "subreddit": "unpopularopinion", "body": "I can’t read this because it’s just a wall of text… so just an FYI to you.
