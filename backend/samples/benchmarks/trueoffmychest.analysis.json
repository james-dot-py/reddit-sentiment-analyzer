We (both 33) own a company together that does financial stuff (keeping it vague), and it's been very successful. We aren't publicly in a relationship, we don't talk about our marriage, or have public social media where it discloses our relationship.\n\nAll this is to say, to the public eye, my wife and I are business partners, unmarried, and with our own \"separate\" marriages. My wife goes by her middle name and maiden name for work, and by her 'legal name' when dealing in personal matters. Say her name is Jane Mary Doe, nee Fish, she goes by Jane Doe when not at work and Mary Fish at work.\n\nNow, full disclosure: I did NOT cheat on my wife.\n\nWe were at a work function and kissed briefly when arriving (In car), and apparently someone saw it. I woke up this morning to an email addressed to me saying that if I don't want my wife, Jane Doe, finding out I'm cheating on her with my business partner, Mary Fish, then I am to pay them off with an amount I won't be listing here, but is quite a sum. They included photos of me and \"mary\" together, and then, and this is the best part, sent a link to Janes facebook page where she notoriously doesn't post her own face anywhere.\n\nMaybe the title should have been \"I am being blackmailed for cheating on my wife with my wife\". I'm both amused and horrified. Thanks for listening, Reddit. My wife hasn't stopped laughing to commiserate with me yet, and I needed an ear.

Gave me the biggest hug. I thought she would appreciate the gift but I never thought she would react so strongly.

He said that I agreed under false pretenses but I told him that he could leave me. He would rage and beg and love bomb and even cry that he missed me.

He was my best friend and my entire world and had been since I was 15. I’ve truly never lived a life without him. We were separated for 5 months between May to about 3 weeks before he died, and we still did just about everything the same besides couple things and living together. We had just gotten back together and things were looking up when I got the call. Anyways in November I get a message on Facebook from a woman saying she’s pregnant and it was my husband’s baby. I didn’t know how to respond but we ended up meeting up she said that her and my husband had a one night stand. Now if she isn’t lying and the baby is his then that would mean we weren’t separated at the time and for some reason I have hope it is his. Now that sounds insane but we separated because he had a mid life crisis after I was done trying to have a baby. We had been trying for 18 years and I had done 4 rounds of fertility treatments and after my 4th miscarriage I couldn’t do it anymore. He wanted to do one more round but mentally I couldn’t do another round. He had this midlife crisis and we fought constantly, then decided to take some time apart. Now all I can think about is if this babies his then at least one of his dreams come true. Then there’s a mini him out there changing the world just like we dreamed of. He can’t come back but his legacy can still move forward.\n\nUpdate- So I met with the attorney on Thursday and my husband’s estate is fine. Under the circumstances the baby isn’t owed anything, but I wouldn’t feel right not at least set up a college fund and a trust along with some family heirlooms. I know a lot of you were pretty against that considering how the child came about. I agree it’s a terrible situation for me if it’s true but an innocent kid shouldn’t have to suffer because two adults messed up. I have more than enough money including money from my husband’s trust fund we never used just sitting in an account. So if the baby is his I will set up a trust fund, a college fund, and somehow a way for them to get my husband’s family heirlooms. I don’t want to be involved when I wrote this I was deep into grief I thought I did but i think it was grief talking. I lost everything when my husband died he was my only family and my best friend. I was a foster kid and my bio mom died long before I could meet her. There wasn’t a father on any of my paperwork. I have nobody and my mental health has been awful so please give me some grace. I wrote this thinking maybe someone else went through this or felt the same and I appreciate all the comments good and bad. I don’t think the baby’s my husband nor do I think he cheated. She told me they met at this bar they both went to in Colorado on a specific date and went back to his hotel room and had a one night stand. She named the bar he went to and the same dates my husband was in Colorado for his yearly ski trip. Seemed very convincing until I realized you can go on his Facebook, or instagram and see that exact information publicly. I asked his friends because they were on the trip with him and they were very confused because apparently he didn’t even stay at the bar long and left with one of his friends. Then they made me cry because they went on about how much he used to talk about me and how much he loved me. I don’t think he did my husband hated cheaters but I guess sometimes people hate them and still do it. I didn’t want to be that person that said their husband would never when anybody is capable. I am still doing the DNA test under my attorneys advice. It’s just to prove to the court just in case she tries to take us to court for anything. That’s all for now I see a therapist on Wednesday so hopefully she’ll help. The baby is supposedly due one day this week so I’ll update if I get anymore information.\n\nFinal update- The baby was born on the 5th she was a beautiful baby girl I saw the pictures on Facebook. I really don’t think she’s my husband’s baby. First off she hasn’t messaged me back nor has she responded to the calls from my lawyer. She stopped communicating once I said I had a lawyer so I think that’s my answer. She also has a picture of her boyfriend with the baby and they look like twins. Also I commented on the post congratulating her and then messaged her again privately just letting her know if she still wanted to do the DNA test and then I got blocked. So I think the answer is clear but honestly I’m so glad now that it’s not. I’ve been seeing a therapist and a grief group and so far it has helped a lot. I’ve seen my therapist twice because i really was not okay like even before my husband’s death. So it’s gonna be a long road but I think I’m gonna make it!

I’m fit (I run ultramarathons), sober, and I’ve spent my whole life walking on eggshells around my father. He fights with everyone his brother, his friends, his coworkers and he has physically abused me in the past (punched me in the head when I was a kid).\n\n\nThe Silence:\nIt’s not just the aggression, it’s the neglect. In 29 years, we have never had a single 1 on1 father son conversation. Not once. Whenever I try to speak to him, even about normal, everyday things, he shuts me down. He refuses to make eye contact with me and is constantly avoidant. Because of this, I stopped seeing him as a father a long time ago. To me, he is just a stranger I live with.\n\n\nThe Incident:\nTonight, the power went out because the cats tripped over a wire. It was an accident. My father is currently very sick and physically weak (heart problem, diabetes, high blood pressure his in very serious health conditions), but he went into a rage. He started screaming at my sister and me, demanding we go out at midnight to buy an extension cord.\n\nI tried to de escalate. I told him to calm down. He got in my face. Then he tried to punch me.\n\n\nThe Switch:\nIn the past, I would have cowered. But tonight, something switched. I didn't punch him back, but I pushed him away to protect myself. Because he is weak, he fell down.\nI expected to feel horror or guilt. Instead, I felt, nothing. Actually, I felt good. I realized I wasn't scared of him anymore. I looked at him on the floor and asked, \"It’s been so long since you’ve been like this, what kind of father are you?\"\n\nHe looked at me and said: \"So what?\"\n\n\nThe Aftermath:\nHe told me to get \"the f*** out of his house.\" My mom and sister told me to leave just to let things cool down. I walked out, but I eventually came back in to sleep because I have nowhere else to go. He is hiding in his room now, silent.\n\n\nI think he realized that the physical intimidation card he used for 29 years has finally expired. He knows I could hurt him if I wanted to, and he knows I saw him fall.\n\n\n\nI’m glad tonight happened. \nThe monster in my head is gone. \nHe’s just a bitter landlord now.\n\n\nEdit: I live in Malaysia (Southeast Asia). In our culture, it is very common for unmarried children to live with parents into their late 20s or 30s. It is not \"mooching\" it is the family norm here.\n\nIt is currently 30°C (86°F) at night here.\n\nThe accident didn't cut power to the house. It just shorted out one single extension cord in the living room. We had lights, fans, and power everywhere else.\n\nMy father wanted us to drive out at midnight to replace a $10 wire that could have easily waited until morning. His reaction (screaming and trying to punch me) was about control, not electricity.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone.\nreading these comments made me realize I’m not crazy, and I’m not alone. \n\nTo anyone else dealing with a bully at home The moment you realize they need your fear more than you need their approval, the game is over. You hold the cards now. \nStay strong, stay sober, \nand don't let them drag you down to their level.\n<33\n\n\nPs: To whoever said it’s fake/AI, u can check my progress on my profile.

But well before that happened, only like a week after the attack, I had an extremely awkward conversation with my father.\n\nWe were discussing the crime and I said I was sure that if and when he was arrested, the man would claim I had consented. My father pointed out that I had visible injuries (still visible, only several days after what happened), injuries the police had taken photos of when documenting everything, and said how could anyone think I had consented when I had this injury and that one?\n\n\"Well, Dad,\" I said, \"some people like it rough.\"\n\nMy father looked at me blankly. There was a long pause and finally he was like, \"Excuse me?\"\n\nAt first I thought he hadn't heard so repeated myself slightly louder but that got the same blank expression. He said, \"I don't understand.\"\n\nI tried re-phrasing what I had said: \"Some people, they like to hit each other when they have sex.\" I am not one of those people, incidentally, I had only heard of them.\n\nHe looked absolutely shocked. He said he had never heard of such a thing, and why would anyone want to do that?\n\nI really had not expected this. Dad was about 63 years old, had been married to my mom for decades (since 35 or a little younger, after he got his assistant professorship in biology) and was the biological father of my mother's three younger children as well as the stepfather of her four older ones. I had not expected that he would not know anything about this.\n\nTo answer his question I explained that this was not all that uncommon and about BDSM and how there was a whole subculture based around it. My dad was absolutely astonished, and it was just extremely awkward for me to have to educate him on this matter. We both forgot entirely, for a few minutes anyway, about the rape as I explained what little I knew about this topic.\n\n\\[edited for typo\\]", "author": "CatPooedInMyShoe", "score": 5298, "num_comments": 88, "created_utc": 1770735927.0, "permalink": "/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1r13625/after_i_was_raped_i_had_the_most_awkward/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1r13625/after_i_was_raped_i_had_the_most_awkward/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.7807481288909912, "compound_score": -0.7695, "scores": {"negative": 0.7807, "neutral": 0.208, "positive": 0.0113}}}, {"post": {"id": "1qk8bcj", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "My late best friend’s daughter was my nurse today", "selftext": "I lost my best friend 20 years ago in a car crash, he had a daughter who was 8 at the time, she was my goddaughter and I used to babysit her all the time, and after he died me and my wife still used to help her mom out and we continued babysitting her until she got remarried and moved 5 hours away, I tried staying in touch but life happened and I haven’t seen her in years and honestly I thought she forgot about me.\n\nYesterday I fell on my already fucked up back and it was really fucking painful and I needed surgery so I was taken to the hospital, I still haven’t gotten the surgery yet and I’m still there, earlier today when the night shift nurses were changing shifts and telling the morning staff about the patients one young lady kept looking at me and she came and looked at my name and asked if I’m uncle Chris, that’s what my friend’s daughter used to call me and she seemed genuinely surprised and happy, I asked if it was her and she said yea and she came in and Hugged me, she went and asked her supervisor to be my room’s nurse for the day and she kept coming over and speaking with me the entire shift, she’s married now with a kid and one on the way and her stepdad was good to her and her mom which made me happy, she even called her mom and had me speak to her and it was nice catching up, it honestly made me cry a little. \n\nShe told me she’s coming back tomorrow again in the morning and she’s gonna be my nurse again and she promised to bring me delicious cookies that her mom used to make all the time which I loved so much, I know my friend is so proud of her wherever he is and I wish he was here to see the amazing young lady she’s become, this genuinely made me cry for some reason, I spent so much time caring for her when she was little and here we are 20 years later and she’s the one caring for me.

One of the couples is “Jake” and “Emily” (names changed). Emily’s always been the reader in the group – she got me into some fantasy series years ago – but the last couple years she’s gone deep into romantasy. Like, Butcher & Blackbird, Haunting Adeline, The Ritual, God of Malice, all the dark, steamy ones. She talks about them the way some people talk about sports or video games: excited, analyzing the characters, laughing at the banter. It’s clearly her happy place, especially after a rough patch with work and some family crap. I’ve seen how much lighter she is when she’s in the middle of one of those books.\n\nHer husband Jake has never been into reading, which is fine, but he’s gotten increasingly dickish about her choices. He’ll make these snide comments like “Still reading your trashy porn novels?” or “Can’t believe you’re wasting time on that garbage when there’s real literature out there.” She usually just laughs it off or changes the subject, but you can see her shrink a little each time.\n\nLast Saturday we were all at a backyard hangout – maybe 8-10 of us, grilling, beers, music. Emily was telling me and another friend about a scene in Pucking Around that had her cracking up (hockey romance, super spicy, she loves the humor in it). Jake overhears, rolls his eyes, and goes loud enough for everyone to hear: “Yeah, she’s obsessed with that smutty fantasy crap. It’s basically just erotica for women who can’t get it in real life.” Then he laughs like it’s the funniest thing.\n\nThe vibe went dead. Emily went quiet, stared at her drink. A couple people gave awkward chuckles, but I was pissed. I set my beer down and said, straight up: “Dude, why do you feel the need to humiliate your wife in front of her friends for something that makes her happy? She’s not hurting anyone. She’s reading books. If you don’t like them, cool, but shitting on her every time she mentions them is insecure as hell. Knock it off.”\n\nJake got defensive fast – “Whoa, relax man, it was a joke” – but his face was red. Emily looked at me with this mix of surprise and gratitude, then quietly said “Thanks” under her breath. The rest of the night was awkward as fuck; Jake barely talked to anyone, and we all left earlier than usual.\n\nSince then the group chat has been a mess. Two of the guys are saying I overstepped and “should’ve talked to him privately” or “it’s their marriage, not your business.” One girl said she thought Jake was being an ass and appreciated me saying something. Emily texted me separately to say it meant a lot because he’s been dismissive of her hobbies for a while and she feels like she has to hide what she enjoys. Jake hasn’t said shit to me directly yet.\n\nI don’t regret it. Watching him belittle her like that, especially when she’s finally found something that lights her up, felt wrong. But now I’m wondering if I just made things worse for her at home or if I turned a small thing into group drama.\n\nJust had to get this off my chest. Felt good to say it out loud in the moment, but the fallout sucks. Anyone else ever had to call out a friend’s partner like that?

I (24F) was pronounced clinically dead for 12 minutes on my sister’s birthday (22F) last year. A week before her birthday, I had a surgery to remove a blood clot in my renal vein, which was unsuccessful. I was told I needed to redo my renal vein transposition (remove the vein and replace it with a pig artery.) To prevent getting a blood clot or further collapse of my vein, they decided to add a stent as well. I was hospitalized in the Special Care Unit on a Heparin drip with severe gastroparesis until they could schedule the surgery.\n\nI was told the surgery date and asked if we could do it a different day because it was my sister’s birthday (she is my best friend and I didn’t want to ruin her birthday.) You can probably guess from the title of this post that my request obviously didn’t go through. So we prepared for the surgery. I called my sister the morning of my surgery to wish her a happy birthday. We had a good cry and she told me that everything was going to be okay because nothing bad could happen to me on her birthday.\n\nWe went through all the possible complications and I signed the consent forms for the surgery. There was such a small chance of vein rupture that I wasn’t concerned about the possibility, but I was obviously within the <1%. The surgery was going well so far, the surgeon successfully removed the portion of my vein with the solidified blood clot and sutured a pig artery in its place. The next step in the procedure was to deploy the stent into the freshly transposed vein. In stenting procedures, the stent is attached to a balloon and catheter. The balloon is slowly expanded to deploy the stent. As the stent was deployed in my vein, my vein suddenly ruptured at the suture sites. The surgeon clamped both sides of the vein to stop the bleeding, but I had already lost most of the blood in my body. My stats were dropping. My heart stopped. I did not have a heart beat for 12 minutes. I was clinically dead for 12 minutes. 12 minutes of CPR. At 10 minutes, the head surgeon told the resident that I wasn’t going to make it, but this resident had never lost a patient before and we had actually become quite close as I research vascular diseases for my career. Those extra 2 minutes saved my life. I received multiple blood transfusions and was on dozens of machines. Once I was stable, they life flighted me to the nearest trauma hospital. I was given 4 hours to live. 4 hours. My parents and husband had the chance to say goodbye to me before I got on the helicopter. My mom had to call both of my sisters so they could say goodbye over the phone. My sister was celebrating her birthday with a few friends in her apartment when she got the phone call. It absolutely destroyed her, screaming and vomiting from the horror.\n\nAfter I was life flighted, it took them 6 hours to stabilize me. I was immediately put on a ventilator, life support, and multiple drips because my lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, bladder, and brain were not functioning. I was put in a medical coma. While they were trying to control the rest of the bleeding in my open abdomen, they found a tear in my bowel from one of my previous surgeries, requiring me to have another surgery once I was stable. Once I was stable, they told my family I would most likely not make it through the night. My parents had to figure out how to get both of my sisters to my city as we all live in different states. My sister got there the next day and it absolutely destroyed her to see me connected to all the machines. She said I was so swollen, barely recognizable, and cold like death to the touch.\n\nI remained unconscious for 7 days. I was mentally awake on day 5. I was stuck in my brain without physically being able to wake up. I could hear my family talking to me, the nurses calling my name, my husband playing my favorite music, my sister playing me my favorite comfort movies. When I finally woke up, I was so scared and I had all these tubes in my mouth, nose, arms and feet. I was put in restraints for 6 days. During this time, the staples that closed my abdomen tore open, leaving my organs, muscle and entire insides exposed. My poor husband, mom and sister saw this gruesome site. They left me open for 53 days, doing wet to dry packing twice a day until I was put on a wound vac and eventually having a surgical closure. I had to undergo 10 surgeries during this time.\n\nI was on a ventilator for 12 days. I failed multiple breathing trials before I was finally able to come off the ventilator. The ventilator actually damaged my vocal cords and I could barely speak for 2 months. Because of this, I couldn’t communicate so my sister helped me by getting a white board and that’s how we talked for weeks. The first thing I wrote to her was “I love u,” it was all I wanted her to know. That I was here and that I loved her with my whole being. I was in the ICU for 14 days before I was moved to the wound care unit. I had to relearn how to talk, swallow, eat, sit up, walk, use my left arm, use the stairs, basically function like a normal person. I was on a feeding tube for 62 days. I was bed ridden for 6 weeks. I was in the hospital for a total of 70 days.\n\nMy sister was there every single day, 14 hours a day, never leaving my side. She would bring her iPad so we could watch movies to distract me from my pain and trauma. She would wash my face, brush and braid my hair, put aloe on my skin when it burned (I was in a constant lupus flare from all the physical trauma.) After I was released from the hospital, she stayed with me at my house and took care of me every single day. She helped me shower, eat, get dressed, do my physical therapy exercises. She was there for me on my hardest days when the PTSD was so bad I didn’t want to be here anymore. She took me to all of my follow up appointments and multiple ER trips. She was my rock and still is, even though she’s back home, we talk every single day.\n\nThe problem is, I died on her birthday. The most traumatic day of my life was on a day I loved celebrating with her. And now I don’t know how I will be able to celebrate her without reliving the trauma of what I went through. I feel so guilty because she is my best friend and I have so much love for her. We are both so young and I don’t want this to be like this. We’re both obviously in therapy, but this is the first year since this happened and I don’t know how to celebrate her while also protecting my mental health.\n\nEdit: I’m not really sure how to do an edit or update so hopefully this is okay. I’ve read every single comment and cannot thank y’all enough for your input. It was especially helpful to read comments from those who have had similar experiences. The fact of me being clinically dead was obviously a shock, but not surprising. I have 14 medical conditions, 5 of them being rare diseases, one of them being vascular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, making my veins especially fragile, explaining why my vein ruptured so easily during stenting.\n\nI know multiple people were concerned about this, but I am in therapy twice a week and also on-call for emergent PTSD episodes. I am currently on a waitlist for a medical trauma-trained psychologist, but general counseling has been very helpful. I am slowly getting back into my hobby’s and daily life as I am still physically recovering (7 month estimated recovery time.)\n\nI had a long phone call with my sister and good cry after going through all of the comments. We talked about how we both feel about the day, which our feelings are very mutual. I explained how a lot of y’all suggested reframing that day as my rebirth day, like a Phoenix as a couple people said, the day I was saved from unimaginable odds. Since this is the first year, I’m sure it will be the hardest but we are both trying to shift our perspectives. We talked about doing a celebration on a different day this year but I still plan on sending her flowers and a coffee on her actual birthday, but I won’t have to be physically present and fake being okay on that actual day. We will see how this year goes and adjust for the following years as we continue to heal and grow together.\n\nHonestly though, all that matters is that we are able to live out our lives together. We also brought up the idea of creating a bucket list together. We brainstormed a bunch of ideas in both of our current states and our home state to do when we visit each other, so we can maximize our time together and continue to make memories because I didn’t fight for my life to be depressed or silent.\n\nThanks Reddit for your advice and comments!", "author": "rarelyordinaryco", "score": 4286, "num_comments": 272, "created_utc": 1769914917.0, "permalink": "/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qsmp79/i_died_on_my_sisters_birthday_and_dont_know_how_i/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qsmp79/i_died_on_my_sisters_birthday_and_dont_know_how_i/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.7562017440795898, "compound_score": -0.7309, "scores": {"negative": 0.7562, "neutral": 0.2185, "positive": 0.0253}}}, {"post": {"id": "1qw2s3n", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "My wife died after giving birth", "selftext": "7 months ago I became a dad to the most wonderful little baby girl, but my wife died from complications 2 days later. \n\nWe knew from the start that this was going to be a very risky pregnancy and the doctors told her to abort and so did I and her entire family but we’ve been trying for years and we were finally successful, she didn’t want to abort and refused to listen to anyone, she kept saying she’d give up her own life for this child and she made me and her parents promise in case that happened to love it as much as possible, and we’ve kept that promise.

I was the youngest of the family. \n\nI married really young at 20 because I was in love, at the time I was in med school but I dropped out to become a stay at home wife to my husband who was a car mechanic who had his own workshop, he was 5 years older and I was head over heels in love with him, my parents and siblings hated him, they said I had more potential than to just be someone’s stay at home wife and they hated him because they didn’t think he was worthy to be in our family, I refused and I fought them a lot over it, they ended up disowning me when we got married and I thought I was happier without them and for years I was, we all lived in a small town even though my family were all rich they just loved the quietness, and for years and years we didn’t speak even though they all lived a couple of minutes down the street from me. \n\nWe had 4 kids together 3 daughters and our youngest son and we were happy, he was always good to me and even though we weren’t rich we had enough. about 13 years ago however he was in a really bad work accident and he became partially disabled and couldn’t work anymore, and soon after the shop closed down because we couldn’t figure it out, I never worked in my life and never continued my education so I was stuck, my oldest brother came and offered me a job at his law firm as a secretary even though we haven’t talked in decades and I accepted, the pay wasn’t all that much and he treated me no different than he would any other regular employee, he wasn’t interested in getting to rekindle a relationship with me or get to know my family, but I was still grateful for his help nonetheless. Around that time both of my parents passed away a few months between each other and I was completely left out of their will. \n\nIt’s been years now and I’m still working for my brother and my daughters have all put themselves in colleges and they’re all doctors in residency and I’m proud of all of them, my son went to trade school and is a mechanic like his dad and my family still don’t talk to me.

I fell sick to my stomach. I immediately called a friend and she told me to grab as much of my stuff as I could + my cats while “Y” was gone & come stay at her apartment. I did. then, I went back to our house to break up with him. We talked for 3 hours, I cried most of them. but I felt so proud of how calmly I spoke and stayed rooted in my decision to leave someone who would treat me that way. He begged me not to do this. I told him I loved him and that I’d keep in touch to get the rest of my things. & we have. No anger, we’ve talked the past couple days, just a lot of hurt.\n\nWe are both actors/singers in theatre. He was currently producing a show in which he’s the lead and the girl he cheated on me with (who pursued him knowing we were together and while acting like my friend) was his scene partner. I’m currently on a break from theatre. I have no idea how, but the whole cast found out the day after our breakup that he had cheated on me with her & I’d left. Apparently, they were absolutely PISSED. We were both friends with most of them from doing shows together, and they were extremely upset that he did this to me. It started a conversation among the cast that they felt uncomfortable that he’d crossed that line as a producer with a cast member. As of tonight, over half of the cast including the directors decided to walk; they all said they’d quit if Y didn’t step down from his role. He did not step down, so they all quit and the show was cancelled.\n\nAs much as he hurt me, I didn’t want that outcome; I’m not a vengeful person. in fact, I really wish this hadn’t happened because it’s hard to even process being cheated on when it’s suddenly being talked about by a big community of people, all reaching out and making decisions and turning it into a huge event. I was still going to go see the show to support my friends.\n\nI went by the house to make sure Y was okay. I knocked on the door and saw a shadow of someone running away to hide upstairs. He answered the door. I asked if he was okay, and he answered very angrily. He told me the girl he cheated with was there. “Wow.” I said, “I just wanted to check on you. but I guess you’re okay.” He started accusing me of getting people to drop the show. I was in disbelief. I shut it down immediately, but as we talked for a bit, he just continued going from “I’m sorry, you’re right, this isn’t your fault” to accusing me of being part of it to “I am a victim.

They’re punishing me.” When I eventually left, I drove back to my friend’s apartment feeling so manipulated. so guilty for this show being cancelled.\n\nall I did was get cheated on and find out about it.\n\nI know that he is being extremely manipulative and that I have NOTHING to feel guilty for, but I just needed somewhere to type this out because he really got in my head.

I want to use a different B-word but I don’t think I can post with it, just know it is the one I mean. I wish I could type out just how much I hate her right now, so maybe this will help. There’s so much I want to yell at her, or just get off my chest, but we’re at our grandparents' place and I can’t lash out at her like she deserves (and she knows it too). I don’t know how much of it is relevant but here goes hoping I’m less angry when I’m done. \n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nMy family is me and my twin Sebastian (16M and he’s writing this with me), our sister Lisa (17F), our dad Sean (41M) and our (former?) future stepmom Amy (36F) (fake names obvs). Our mom died 9 years ago. Dad didn’t date for 5 years, then briefly dated a disaster called Riley, then took another break from dating. He met Amy around 3 years ago, introduced us 2 years ago, we all moved together to a bigger house a year ago, and they got engaged 6 months ago.\n\nBefore Riley was even in the picture, we weren’t thrilled dad had started dating again but we went to therapy as a family to work through it. We made peace with it for most part, but then Riley came, and she was just the worst. She was rude, jealous of our mom’s memory, gold digger, didn’t like us, she was all around horrible. The three of us kind of made an agreement that we would not allow anyone to erase our mom, we would never allow anyone to adopt us, and we would be polite but keep our distance from whomever dad dated. It felt like we were honoring mom that way, without stopping our dad from moving on. We also started calling the three of us + dad “the Core Four”.\n\nGetting to know Amy though, and then moving in together, we have done a 180 on that (me and Seb more than Lisa). Amy is just good people. She is crazy smart and nerdy (has like 3 degrees (one in psychology which explains a lot) and we all play DnD together), she is successful, artistic, athletic, deadpan hilarious. She has an energy like when we’re around family and they’re all loud and crazy, she talks and people just shut up and *listen*. Don’t know how best to describe that, like she is wise and kind and patient, but also an absolute sigma BAB. She is cool to hang out with, and she loves our dad. She also sets him straight a lot, we kind of default to her as our neutral 3rd party when there’s a disagreement, and she is very good at navigating that. She is just really cool.\n\nShe is also genuinely interested in our lives and hobbies, she has at least one thing with each of us. Seb and her do artsy stuff and they both play tennis, she plays video games with me, she and Lisa read A LOT and go book shopping like every few months, the house is filled with books, she is teaching Lisa how to drive, they are both K-pop fans etc. I honestly think they clicked more quickly and naturally, and vibe the best (whenever Lisa allows it).\n\nAmy also never stops us talking about our mom, she respectfully encourages it. There’s a few pictures of mom around the house still and she’s totally ok with that, like she is not threatened by mom’s presence at all. She once helped Seb make a painting of a photo of the five of us (Dad, mom, Lisa, me and Seb) for our maternal granddad’s birthday. Even my mom’s family like her, my aunt (mom’s sister) and her have become good friends. She asks them and dad about mom when we mention something we all used to do, and we found out a few months ago that she also lost her dad when she was 12. I think that settled a lot of things for Lisa, who I know sometimes uses our mom to try to spite Amy (though again, Amy would either kill her with kindness or just move on).\n\nDad loves Amy, and she makes him happy. Like, she is his balance in a way. They go so well together. Our dad is awesome, patient, smart, strict but kind, goofy sometimes, he has his own hangups but he is slow to anger and always open to discuss anything with us. He doesn’t yell at us (much), but he is supportive and overall has been a great dad. She and dad made it very clear she has absolutely no intention of replacing mom, that she’s a person of authority in the household without being a parent, that she’s open to whatever relationship we want to have with her and it’s a 2-way street. She has never demanded or pushed for anything other than “basic human-to-human respect and kindness”.\n\n**WHY LISA SUCKS**\n\nWhile we are really doing well and getting along great, Lisa sometimes gets whiplash and randomly regresses to Riley-time, especially after Amy and her spend time together having fun. It’s like she’s trying to rile Amy up to justify why she thinks dad dating is a bad idea. She snaps at random stuff just to bump heads, only it’s not working very well because… Amy is just not bumping. She isn’t engaging Lisa when she’s like this, she will maybe set a boundary (like “I will not engage with you when you act like this”) and after that is completely uninterested in Lisa’s outbursts, and lets our dad handle it. \n\nIt doesn't feel like it's out of spite though. Best I can describe it is Amy is living her life, legit happily and willingly making offers and openings to all of us, Lisa included, without making a big deal out of it. When Lisa doesn’t participate and/or says something snarky or downright rude, Amy just shrugs and goes on with her life. If we ask her if she’s upset or angry at Lisa for lashing out, she says she understands how Lisa must be feeling, that everyone is allowed a tantrum every once in a while, and that she knows Lisa is a good girl and she will come around on her own. And true enough, when Lisa then calms down and apologizes (with or without dad’s mediation), again Amy doesn’t make a big deal out of it and they pick up where they left off.\n\nFor example: We were having dinner and Lisa was arguing with her and dad, and said she didn’t want what Amy cooked because it smelled “disgusting” and started insulting Amy’s country where the dish was from, even though she usually loves it. Amy just said “suit yourself” like she could not care less, served the rest of us, and sat down and started eating and talking to Seb and I. Dad took Lisa to talk and after they came back, he asked Amy if it would be ok for Lisa to still sit and eat with us. Amy said “sure” and continued chatting. Lisa apologized for her comments (without dad prompting her) and Amy just smiled, said “thank you” and kept talking to Seb like nothing happened. When the conversation naturally drifted to something related to Lisa, Amy just spoke to her normally.\n\nThe issue is, the very few times Amy *does* respond in kind, when she’s tired or has had enough, nothing we say gets to her, like she stops caring. Like she gets suddenly quiet and throws something back at you, and you just never expect it, because overwhelmingly she is the calm and mature one when there’s an issue. Seb calls this “SABA - Sneak Attack by Amy”. If I could pick one flaw of Amy that would be it. She is just brutal sometimes when she’s had enough, or something bad happens at work, and it just comes out of left field. She destroys you and doesn’t even blink. It is immensely enjoyable to witness when she goes SABA on our behalf, but not so much when we trigger it. \n\nTo clarify, Amy is like, ridiculously patient 99% of the time, and incredibly effective in managing conflict. She also can recognize when she’s close to that line so she either steps away or warns us, and we usually understand and back off, and then she follows up on her own and she always says thank you for waiting to talk. If she goes too low when SABAing, she always apologizes and makes amends. We are quite good at communicating as a family for the most part (thanks to her mostly), but once in a while when we push and Amy *goes there* it’s not good.\n\nSometimes it’s just snark, like once I told her “fuck you” mid-fight, Amy just shrugged and said “your father does that enough, I’ll let him know he has your blessing”. Seb was yelling about a missed practice (his fault), she yawned mid-sentence and got up, he was like “wtf where are you going!?” and she was like “I’m not interested in a baby throwing a tantrum”. It is worse with Lisa, because Lisa goes personal when she’s angry. But when the SABA line is crossed, Amy just doesn’t care. Lisa once asked “how does it feel to know you wouldn’t be here if our mom was still alive?” Amy thought about it and said “I would probably be living my best life in the Bahamas with a rich European prince and no brats to bust my balls, so much better”. Another time Amy was having a pregnancy scare, and Lisa said something like “you will never have children of your own” and Amy just said “I hope not, I like my p_ssy tight, and so does your dad”. It always shocks us when she goes SABA because she is usually kind, considerate and patient.\n\nThe Core Four have discussed all of this in therapy, and Lisa acknowledges she’s just scared and angry at the idea of Amy replacing mom, though we all point out just how uninterested Amy is in that role. I personally don’t feel like she would ever replace mom, and we joke sometimes about calling each other “mother/son”. When Lisa acts out, there are always consequences from dad, things are discussed in therapy, and for a while everything is calm again. The therapist suggested we add Amy to our sessions once in a while, but Lisa is not open to that “yet”. Dad is also bringing up more often whether Lisa should get individual therapy but she doesn’t want to. Legit Lisa and Amy get along so well when Lisa isn’t behaving like this. \n\n**WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY**\n\nYesterday the three of us (Seb, I and Lisa) spent time with our grandparents and cousins, helped them with the snow, then grabbed dinner, and came home late. Dad and Amy were talking about wedding stuff in the kitchen, and we overheard dad discussing adoption very loosely, like if Amy would ever be up for it if we wanted to at some point as adults. Lisa immediately lost it, burst in and started screaming at him about mom, that she hates him, that he is only thinking with his d_ck, then turned to Amy, started insulting her, wished her dead, and said “I will never want a [C-word] like you to be my mom”. Amy just very calmly said “what makes you think I would ever choose *you* to be my daughter?”\n\nThat one *hurt* Lisa, like we could see the physical recoil. Dad took her up to her room and they talked for a long time, there were raised voices, then Lisa was crying, but couldn’t tell what was being said. Amy stayed down, talking to us, clarifying the adoption conversation was entirely hypothetical. We asked her more questions, she was responding slowly and quietly. She didn’t answer us when we asked about wedding prep or how she was feeling. She was shaking and trying to keep it together, I have never seen her like this. We were quiet for a bit, then Seb told her what she said was a very low blow, and she smiled sadly and just said “maybe so”.\n\nWhen dad came down Amy got up in slow motion, put on her coat, gathered some stuff and was out the door in like 2 minutes. Dad was almost crying, trying to get her to stay and talk. It was late, snowing, she was whispering “Not tonight. I have to leave. Be there for your sons. I’m sorry” over and over and she started crying and she got in her car and left. \n\nWe sat down with dad, he was a mess, he let us know Lisa will be getting individual therapy on top of family therapy and it was non-negotiable. He asked us if we felt we needed individual therapy as well. Seb said no, I said I’m not sure right now, and we tried to talk a bit about what happened. He asked how we are feeling, but he was a wreck and then he started tearing up, so we just hugged him and he cried so hard. He cried so much. I have not seen my dad cry so hard since mom died. He kept telling us it’s ok and he didn’t want us to worry, but he was just crying and I had no words, I just kept saying I am sorry, and Seb was telling him it will be ok and Amy will be back and we will all work it out, and he kept saying “no she won’t, not this time she won’t”. \n\nHe then started saying he was sorry, and asked if we knew he loved us, and then he asked if he had neglected us, if we felt he didn’t love us enough after Amy moved in, if he was a good dad. I wanted to p_nch Lisa so hard in that moment, for making him doubt that even for a second. As if moving on from our mom after almost a decade, and landing someone he is genuinely happy with and who IS A GOOD PERSON, is a sin.\n\nAmy wasn’t in the house today. Dad has red eyes and he looks like he has aged 10 years. He said good morning, I asked if Amy came home last night, he said no but not to worry and she is safe. He spoke very quietly, made us breakfast. When Lisa came down, he just gave her a look and turned around, didn’t speak to her. She started crying, saying she’s sorry, and went to hug him. He stepped back and told her “I don’t want to hug you right now” and his voice was just shattered. She just lost it and kept crying and apologizing, kept saying she really likes Amy and she wants them to get married and for him to be happy. \n\nShe said she loves him, and kept asking if he still loves her, and dad said “I will always love you as my daughter, but I don’t love you as Lisa right now”. I think that’s the harshest thing he has ever said to any of us. I didn’t think he had it in him. I am glad he said it, I am happy Lisa kept crying.

It wasn’t fun. I confronted my dad about what my sister told me, and he admitted it was true. It was hard for me to hear because I had a boyfriend cheat on me a few months back and my dad had been there for me. I also told him about what his girlfriend had been saying. He was upset about it and said he’d take care of it and talk to her. It seems like she’s been nicer but idk. I don’t really trust her.\n\nMy dad and I are ok, though. I’m still upset about what he did, but he could still be a good dad and not a good husband? It’s kind of complicated. Like maybe his gf deserves to be with him. That’s mean.\n\nUnfortunately stuff with my mom has been bad. We used to always go to the ballet at Christmas, it was our thing together. But a few years ago after the divorce she said she didn’t want to that year and just never asked me to go again. I asked a few times but she always said she couldn’t do it.\n\nBut last week she made a post with her, Penny and Emma (her stepdaughter that she wanted me to give the doll to). And obviously they were at the ballet. When I saw Penny the next day I feel like she wanted me to ask about it but I didn’t. She asked me if I wanted to go in on mom’s birthday present (it’s in a few weeks). I asked if I was going to be invited to her party/ dinner and she said that shouldn’t matter so I told her I’m not getting mom anything for stuff I’m not invited to. I got her a Christmas present and she didn’t invite me over and I had gotten her a wedding present and I wasn’t invited. Penny told me they didn’t want to invite me to the wedding because mom didn’t want me reporting anything back to my dad so she could enjoy the wedding (she eloped in the Caribbean).\n\nThat made me really upset so I called my mom later and asked if it was true. She was annoyed I could tell and told me she’d meet me to talk but I had to promise I’d listen. So I drove all the way out to talk to her and she was going on about boundaries and how if I wanted her in my life I had to respect them. And her boundaries are like I’d need to give her 3 days notice before seeing her and not asking the day of or before. And I’d have to invite Emma to anything we did and put effort into being a big sister to her and I was SO OVER it. I asked her again if the wedding this was true and she said that she just wanted to enjoy her wedding after everything. \n\nI never have ever gossiped with my parents about the other. Even when I knew that the wanted to I never did. And even if i did, my own mom cared more about her ex finding out about her wedding than having me there. \n\nI kind of lost it at that. I know it was wrong but I couldn’t help it. I’ve just been keeping things inside for so long and trying to get her to love me again and it’s pointless. She doesn’t want me around and I don’t want to be around anyone that doesn’t want me there.  So I told her that, and I told her that I had no idea that dad had an affair until Penny told me but at this point I didn’t blame him, she could have fun with my replacement but it won’t ever be the same because she’s NOT her mom, she had a mom and it’s not her and she’ll always pick her mom over her. My friends moms \\*\\*go out of their way to see their daughters\\*\\* and I have to beg mine for scraps. I wish I had told her where to shove her \\*boundaries\\* but I didn’t have the juice to do that haha. \n\nBut I did tell her to forget that she ever had me and left. She called me a bunch but I googled it and since I’m 19 I’m allowed to block her number. So Penny and her husband have been calling and texting me so I told them she needs to respect MY boundaries. \n\nI think I’ll be ok but it’s been hard. I have a therapist who helps me sometimes but I think cutting my mom out will be good long term. I don’t want to end up like her, and if Penny wants to cut me off for that that’s fine. My friends and I decided to get an apartment starting this summer. I think it’ll be good for everyone. My dad was sad when I told him but I need to start my life. Like I know it’s kinda bs because he’ll be paying my rent but we promised we’d get dinner at least twice a week. I know he did something bad but I kinda meant what I said about not blaming him. And at least he’s always been there for me unlike her.

I'm a 34 year old man, and for the last 12 years I've been caregiving for my parent, starting almost immediately after university. It was a full time job immediately, but it very quickly became a 24-hour job. I've never had an actual career, it was so time consuming I lost contact with all my friends.

She’s gotten her hormones checked at my request, but it seems that she’s honestly just fine not wanting it more than once a month.\n\nEven during that one time we have sex, she’s had to have a perfect day, had to have me take some chores she owns off her plate, give her a nice dinner and tend to her, lots of flirting throughout the day, and lots of non-sexual affection for even a chance that sex occurs and sometimes it doesn’t happen. I try not to show it, but I am worn out trying to put her in a good mood and trying to be perfect just for a chance to have her want sex with me too.\n\nI don’t think this is sustainable or realistic for me. I feel like I am not doing it for the right reasons. I don’t want to perform affection that doesn’t feel real for me. I want to hold and hug my wife and make her life easy because I love her, not because I want something out of her. And over the past few years, I’ve been doing it with other motives. I also want her to choose to want sex with me, not go along with it because I shouldered so much responsibility in making sure she felt “head space” or it wouldn’t happen. I would like to see, if we take sex off the table and performing affection off the table, what the baseline level of real intimacy between us is.\n\nI get that responsive desire is real and for some people it’s not easy to initiate and go for it, but I’d like to not have to negotiate for sexual desire and understand aspects of responsive desire a bit more responsibly. What I mean when I say this is: I’d like to not always be “in charge” of ensuring she’s had a good day enough to want sex. I’d like it happening naturally. For example, she’s had a good day without my intervention, I initiate affection because that specific expression of affection makes ME feel good too- good enough to want to share with her, and THAT in turn makes her want sex with me. What I’m trying to say is, I don’t want to do it FOR her alone, or for her sake alone.\n\nI expressed this to her and she’s taken it completely wrong. Because to her, she hears no cutesy names throughout the day multiple times a day, no massages twice a week, no breakfast in bed, no princess treatment by making her life easy, no indulging her moods needlessly.\n\nI keep saying that just because I don’t want to PERFORM affection does NOT mean it won’t exist or that I’d stop doing special things for her. I just wanna do it for the right reasons and if I feel like it too. Isn’t it more special that way if it’s real for me too?\n\nShe disagrees. I keep telling her that what we have right now, me trying to manage all of it for her is not healthy. I want to love her in ways that feel authentic to me too, and yes, even if it means I stop certain acts of affection *on demand*, I will. But that is a GOOD thing in the long run.\n\nI don’t think it’s responsible of her to base all her responsive desire on what I have to do to earn that desire. I don’t want to “earn” it.

My mother was a very hard working woman (still is) and my dad was extremely lazy. My mom was the bread winner and one day she told my dad to go and work. He had his own Locksmith business but usually would decline any work that came to him. This day he decided to listen to my mom and go take a job. My mom worked from home, she had a room where she would do her client’s hair. Long story short, she had me (9 years old at the time) take care of my infant brother while she worked. All I remember was sitting in the living room, feeding him his bottle, then getting up to go to the kitchen to put his bottle away. I was opening the fridge with one hand, and in that exact moment the baby squirmed out of my arm and fell on the floor. I remember picking him up instantly and him crying a very painful cry. Today, my mom and I were talking and somehow got into this subject. I told her how she shouldn’t have left a 9 year old unsupervised with an infant. And she agreed but also explained that she had no choice because she had been doing a Keratin treatment on her client and she didn’t want the baby inhaling the chemicals from it. She also explained how she was in charge of paying the rent, utilities, her car, and my dad’s locksmith truck that was under her name. I mentioned how my father came home that day and whooped my ass so hard I still remember it. And she said “good, you deserved it” which really struck something in me. This is something I’ve always carried with me and been extremely ashamed of. Even though my little brother is perfectly fine now, it was still a very traumatic time for a 9 year old.

You were a stupid little girl who didnt listen when I told you not to get up” brought up emotions in me that I thought I had put to rest. I had to look away from her to hide my watery eyes.

He was an up-and-coming comedian who had recently opened for a very well known comedian.\n\nThis is true, he put the recording on the TV, trying to impress me- I assumed.\n\nHe said he wanted to introduce me to some friends who could help me. They could give me money, maybe I could work for them. They like to help girls like me. He tried to kiss me. I pulled away and asked him to take me back to my friends house. He screamed at me. He tried to kiss me again. I froze up. I thought he was going to hit me. He shouted at me to go get in his car.  He yelled at me and told me I wasn't worth it after what I did to my hair and how I looked. Told me what a piece of shit I was the whole car ride back.

They don't allow photography out of respect for the victims.\n\nEvery since, every single time I'm in a cinema or concert or church, looking at the hair on the backs of peoples heads, it brings back that my memory of that display case.\n\nI'm not really looking for ways to get over it!

They barely speak, so our families aren’t close anymore.\n\nRecently, my mom attended a celebration and ran into her niece who is my cousin, the daughter of that sister. For context, my cousin is very well-off and independent. She owns a finance-related business, lives comfortably in a villa, travels abroad regularly, changes cars often, and her kids go to good schools. She’s not someone who depends on a man to survive. That’s when my mom found out what really happened in my cousin’s marriage and honestly, it’s worse than I imagined. My cousin’s husband was having an affair with one woman. But it wasn’t some distant or secret situation. He brought his mistress into their home. She was physically present in my cousin’s space, her safe place, without her ever realizing what was happening. The scariest part? There were no obvious signs. Her husband was always by her side, attentive, involved. His phone was never hidden since he was always open, no secrecy, no suspicious behavior. He played the role of a devoted husband so well that my cousin never suspected anything. Not once. At one point, they even traveled abroad, and he brought the mistress on the same plane. My cousin had no idea. Imagine sitting on a flight, trusting your partner completely, while the person he’s cheating with is literally there too. Everything only came out because the mistress’s husband happened to be a private investigator. When he became suspicious, he gathered concrete evidence; messages, movements, proof. The situation escalated so far that the police got involved since cheating in marriage is kind of a crime in my country and if you get caught, you can get arrested for it and go to jail. This wasn’t speculation or hearsay. When my cousin found out, she acted immediately. She filed for divorce without hesitation. No public drama, no bargaining, no “let’s try again.” She chose dignity and walked away. Period!! And this is where something inside me broke. Instead of supporting her, my mom’s reaction was basically: “She shouldn’t have divorced him so quickly. Men make mistakes. She already has kids. She should reconsider.” I was stunned. This is the same woman who raised me on independence and self-respect. The same woman who told me my entire life to never tolerate disrespect, to never depend on a man, to always choose myself. Yet when a woman does exactly that after extreme betrayal, psychological manipulation, and public humiliation and my mom thinks she should go back? It made me realize something deeply unsettling: if this had been me, she would have told me the same thing. All those values suddenly feel conditional. Like they only apply until a woman is married, has children, or “has too much to lose.” I’m angry, disappointed, and honestly heartbroken.

hi guys i’m (19F) using a throw away account\n\nyesterday i had sex for the first time with a guy (23M) i’m casually seeing. painful is one way of putting it. i didn’t reach climax but he did.\n\nnow the weird part. afterwards, he started crying. and i don’t mean like a few tears running down his cheeks. he started full on bawling on my chest. i was really confused and wondered if i was already terrible at sex. i asked him what was wrong and he said he didn’t know and that he usually cries after sex. i have never in my life heard of such a thing tbh. he wanted to do it again but i was a little put off by the entire situation. that might have been really mean of me but when he left he said that i was lying there like a lemon and he should’ve started laughing instead. so i said at least i didn’t cry. i’ve ignored him since then but he keeps sending me messages. all i’m trying to figure out is why he cried\n\nedit: thank you for your comments guys, i definitely gained some insight. he wants to see me tonight but i said i think we should talk first. he agreed so i think i might finally get an explanation\n\n**Update (TW)**: finally have an answer. it’s 5am and i can’t sleep so i thought i’d update now. brace yourselves.\n\nsaw him last night. he came to my place. we sat on my couch and it was awkward for a bit, neither of us saying anything. he said he was sorry for leaving abruptly\n\nsince he wasnt saying anything else i decided i’d express myself first. i said that i didn’t appreciate being called a lemon, even if i struggled to find the context of why. that last night he took my virginity and if anything i would have cried with him as i really saw this relationship developing with him and lastly that i can’t comfort someone if i don’t know why they’re crying, but it didn’t mean i was shunning him for it.\n\nhe took a really deep breath and went out with it all. i didn’t interject once but wow it hit me like a tonne of bricks. he said that he didnt mean to call me a lemon and he only said it in the heat the moment. that when he was younger, he was touched inappropriately. he didnt go into details but he said it was around the time he was around my age and he hated himself for lying there. he says he doesnt think thats all why he cries though and that hes always been that way. even when he touches himself, he cries when he finishes. he went into explicit detail with one sexual encounter with a older woman and how it was the one time he didnt cry but instead felt disgust. i put two and two together and figured he might have been SA’d by an older woman and his trauma revolved around feeling guilty about being sexual. i just wanted to give him a big hug.\n\nas we hugged, i thanked him for telling me and told him we could sit with it all for a moment. that i didn’t feel guilty about losing it to him so he shouldnt feel guilty about giving it to me. in the back of my mind, i was wondering why he hadnt told me this beforehand, not that it would change anything. just that it would’ve made sense and i could have comforted him. he did eventually push me away and say that he didn’t want to get emotional around me and we shouldnt bring it up again. i agreed to keep the peace.\n\nwe did have sex again. he did cry into my chest again. i comforted him again. properly this time. afterwards, he sat up and asked me why i didn’t cry, especially since i lost my virginity to him and this was the second time. it sounded a little accusatory to me so i asked him why he thought that. he went on and said that he expected me to since i had never been touched before. i started getting uncomfortable again. i told him that people handle sex differently, how i was emotional but i don’t cry easily. that rubbed him up the wrong way and he asked does that make me more feminine than you for crying? at this point i was fed up and gently said that he was starting to punish me for something i had no part of in his past, and it wasnt fair. i doubled down by saying first i was a lemon, and now i was not feminine enough for him. it just sounds ridiculous. he sat there for a moment before speaking in an angry, hushed voice about how every other girl hes been with has cried with him save for a few. then he sniffed and i thought he was going to cry again.\n\nafter comforting him again, i told him that he needed to see a therapist and that although i was here to talk to, i wanted him to heal instead of punishing himself. he disagreed. he said he processed it through sex. i had nothing to say to that so we spent the rest of the night cuddling before he left. i’ve been thinking about it since then.", "author": "putmeinamoviexo", "score": 2107, "num_comments": 292, "created_utc": 1770662420.0,

I was living on a college campus at the time, and like most college students, had meals at the campus dining hall.\n\nI had just returned to campus after taking a weekend trip to see my boyfriend. I got back around noon on that Monday. I was hungry when I got back, so of course I decided to go to the dining hall.\n\nI’m a simple girl. That day, my lunch was similarly simple. I had a burger and some fries. The fries on campus were pretty dry so usually I grabbed some ketchup to dip them in. Of course, the cheap ass dining hall ran out of ketchup.\n\nI saw some strange off brand sriracha sauce, and figure that mixing some sriracha and mayo would be a suitable replacement. Let me say, that I have a high tolerance for spice, the spice was not the problem. I frequently eat spicy food. I had sat down in a corner of the hall and ate my meal. After eating, I scrolled on my phone or something, I don’t remember. All I know is my stomach then started to hurt. I think I assumed it was gas or something so I didn’t get up and go to the bathroom. That was a mistake.\n\nMy insides went from a mild 2/10 bathroom emergency, to an IMMEDIATE 10/10. I grabbed my stuff and panicked. I looked around, and of course there was no bathroom inside of the dining hall. Otherwise, you’d have a ton of people like me, who’d eat one meal and the sit there and study until the next meal came around to save money.\n\nThe closest women’s bathroom was on the opposite side of the building. Knowing what I know now, I should’ve just went to the men’s, which happened to be on the same side of the building. Why? Probably misogyny. /s\n\nI have never squeezed my ass cheeks together tighter than I did while running to this damn bathroom. This was do or die and I was not going to explosively shart in my leggings in front of all my peers.\n\nI rounded the corner into the bathroom, and relief sets in. I opened and entered the stall. I don’t even think I got it locked, just kind of tossed my backpack against it. I pull my pants down and throw my ass onto the seat. I made it.\n\nUntil I reached around to wipe.\n\nMy hand found much, much more than I bargained for. Horror set in. Slowly, I had turned my head around to behold the abhorrent scene. It was as if a bomb of feces had gone off against the back of the stall.\n\nI am not proud of what I did. I cleaned myself off the best I could, assessed the rest of the damage, and concluded that I could never fathom cleaning the amount of shit that I put on this bathroom stall. I said a silent apology to whoever found it and the janitors. As unlucky as I was, I was lucky enough that I could quickly gather my things, wash my hands, and escape with no one knowing.\n\nI ran all the way home and called my boyfriend. In hindsight, I was incredibly lucky, because after telling him the ordeal I went through, he just laughed. It was only three months in and he still liked me after learning I was a hit and run shitter.\n\nIt’s been four years, and while I haven’t committed any crimes against public bathrooms since, my boyfriend still thinks I’m sexy even though I have secrets I can never share.\n\nI’m really sorry to the people I traumatized for life in that bathroom.\n\nEdit: I was inspired to share my story because of similar stories I’ve read about sugar free gummy bears.", "author": "throwaway10773", "score": 1838, "num_comments": 101, "created_utc": 1770341732.0, "permalink": "/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qx46vh/i_shit_all_over_a_public_bathroom_stall/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qx46vh/i_shit_all_over_a_public_bathroom_stall/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.664026141166687, "compound_score": -0.6345, "scores": {"negative": 0.664, "neutral": 0.3064, "positive": 0.0295}}}, {"post": {"id": "1qssc6z", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "My girlfriend dumped me because I am out of her league", "selftext": "I (25M) started dating a woman (23) one year ago.

It was not easy, but it was progress.\n\nThen six months ago I finally got my dream job as a marketing specialist making $30 an hour. For once in my life, I felt like all the struggling actually meant something. We live in a high cost of living area, but this income finally let us feel normal. We could eat out once in a while. We could help family at Christmas. We could plan a wedding. We could dream about visiting my family in Asia, something I have not been able to do for years.\n\nAnd now everything is falling apart. Again.\n\nHis car insurance is going up by $500 because of a minor accident three months ago that was deemed his fault. The lady in front of him braked too fast and he couldn’t stop on time. I’m grateful he is okay and I get why it happened. I really do. But that does not change the fact that this increase will eat his entire paycheque. Completely. He can’t give up the car because he drives all over the province for work. There will be no savings. No flexibility. No safety net. I will have to carry more rent, more groceries, more bills. All of it.\n\nJust like that, we are back to survival mode. Back to counting every dollar. Back to saying no to everything. Back to that awful feeling of working nonstop and still getting nowhere. It feels like all the progress I fought so hard for just evaporated.\n\nAnd as if that was not enough, my contract for this job ends in July. I do not even know if they will absorb me.

I hate seeing her like that and I only met her once since the break up at the hospital and while she acted respectful and gracious she really believed she lacked something because she asked why not her.\n\nAnyway I have spoken to her now and didn’t listen to my family. My gf, my brother’s best friend and I went to eat dinner at her parents’ house where she’s living now. We are the only ones on the same side with my family against it and my dad not caring either way. I told her everything and as I expected she was skeptical at first so my brother’s best friend showed her the texts. She looked distant and shocked and then she said that she didn’t know he hated her so much to do something like this. I told her I don’t think it is hate. He is distraught and his pride hurt since she broke up with him. She didn’t say much but thanked us and admitted that she was going mad with thoughts.\n\nYesterday she texted me and my gf to thank us. She said when we told her the truth she felt even more in despair but having time to reflect on it she could finally get that it wasn’t her and that she truly believes that this will help her in her healing journey. I called her and we talked for an hour. She promised tht she will never tell anyone about us telling her the truth. That she only needed this information for herself and her own healing. I thanked her for that. She is moving away because she’s found a new job and wanted a new start. She assured me that this decision had nothing to do with me telling her but it was something she’s been contemplating since the break up. I immediately thought about my brother and how he would take news like these.\n\nI had dinner with him today and I told him that she was moving away. I thought he would hear it soon so it rather came from me in case he wanted to rage and be upset rather than from strangers. He didn’t react but he didn’t say much afterwards either. He looked defeated. We just sat there drinking. I feel very sad for him and I hope he feels better soon.\n\nI know people will accuse me of interfering and not siding with my family but I don’t regret anything", "author": "RealisticMail9426", "score": 1796, "num_comments": 120, "created_utc": 1770511196.0, "permalink": "/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qyui50/i_told_my_brothers_ex_that_he_proposed_to_her/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qyui50/i_told_my_brothers_ex_that_he_proposed_to_her/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.4868770241737366, "compound_score": -0.2039, "scores": {"negative": 0.3585, "neutral": 0.4869, "positive": 0.1546}}}, {"post": {"id": "1r26sbr", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "My dad loves my brother in law more than he loves me and it hurts", "selftext": "I have a twin sister who got married last year to her long term partner of 7 years, we were all classmates and they were together since 11th grade, and my dad absolutely loves him more than he loves me.

They also had a tough upbringing so it’s been reflecting onto us. They weren’t abusive by any means, just no nonsense and terrifying.\n\nI had a very close relationship with my sister. She was like a second mom to me. She was the type of person to give you advice, not judge you, let you fall asleep on her shoulder, and ask you if you needed anything. She loved to sing and play the piano. She also loved being around children which is why she treated my brother like he was her child. One big thing I admired about my sister was her confidence and independence. No matter the situation, she was determined and always had an “I got this” mindset which is why I knew I was going to lose her when she told me she couldn’t do it anymore.\n\nMy sister got cheated on by her boyfriend who damaged her self esteem on top of it so she coped with that by drinking. My parents ended up kicking her out of the house because it got so bad. Her childhood best friend took her in and my sister eventually ended up quitting.

She texted me a paragraph saying they changed their minds and didn’t want her back, called her an untrustworthy monster, and were afraid she would relapse and hurt the family again. The one sentence that stuck out to me was “I love you (my name) but I can’t do it anymore”.

I started drinking as a direct result of my time in the military, and continued to drink heavily and pretty much daily for about 8 years. I was on the verge of losing my husband and children and, for me, that was my bottom; I was just fucking done. I went to a 30 day inpatient treatment center across the country, and I still maintain to this day that not only did I need an abrupt change to the horrible cycle I was in, but my family also needed the break from me. It was the right decision.\n\nDuring my time in rehab I went to AA meetings, and felt like the program was what would work for me when I got home so upon my return I did 90 meetings in 90 days, found a home group, and got myself a sponsor. For the first 2.5 years or so of my sobriety I really leaned on/into the program and I fully credit that, as well as the people in the fellowship, with helping establish and maintain a new kind of lifestyle; however, I started noticing a few things:\n\n\\-I noticed that everyone in the rooms always speak about how difficult it is to remain sober, and how every day seems to be a struggle. For me, when I was ready to stop drinking I just stopped and never looked back. I just live my life without alcohol 🤷‍♀️ I have had more than one person tell me that if it isn’t hard, I’m not doing it right.\n\n\\-I see people telling newcomers that if they are on any “mild-altering substances”, including mental health medication, then they aren’t sober. I call fucking bullshit, and it’s not only no one else’s business but it’s downright irresponsible and dangerous.\n\n\\-People lean on these meetings in a way that shows me that they traded one addiction for another.\n\n\\-I am told that I owe AA my life, and it is my responsibility to basically go for the rest of my life in order to give to others what was freely given to me. Oh, and I’m not supposed to take any credit for my sobriety - that’s all thanks to my “higher power”.\n\n\\-Another person in the program recently had three other people in the fellowship literally break into their house because they were unable to answer the phone due to being in bed with the flu. These three individuals accused my friend of being “under the influence”, called their parents (this person is 25 years old), and have been lobbying to get them removed from service positions.\n\nYou get the idea. I am just so fucking over the fact that I HAVE given back, I HAVE worked my program, I AM sober, and yet I’m constantly being told how to live my life, that I’m being selfish by considering leaving the program, and that I’m not really sober because I take medication for clinical depression. Being off of my medication is not an option. To be clear, I give AA a ton of credit for helping me get/stay sober. I just don’t understand how that means I owe them the rest of my goddamn life. I mean, why would I stay when I’m “doing it wrong” anyway? If I wanted my whole life to revolve around alcohol in any way, I would have kept drinking.

So she got all petty and stormed off straight to the break room to my boyfriend to tell him I’d been sleeping with (now) husband. I’m told she looked smug as fuck. By chance, husband was there too. Everyone was silent, looking back and forth between the two. They’d been expecting drama for soooo long.

We do contract work, so no regular employees and no HR, just repeated contracts with people \"above\" and \"below\" us in the supply chain. The function was with other people in our field, not our employees. The people with whom we work regularly know we are married, and in telling them, we've just proved our point. One of them, after finding out, consistently refers to my wife as \"OP's wife,\" even at work functions and conferences when I am not present.\n\nI don't think people do... had a few comments saying that \"can't be her name, no ones called Jane Doe\". I don't mind the fake comments because I would absolutely be commenting the same if it didn't happen to me (The AI comments sting a bit, though I will admit!)\n\nI will say the reason she uses her middle, and not her first name, for work isn't due to the \"we're not married\" at work thing, it's because her parents were 'those' parents and named her something uniquely unprofessional. Love her name, and I think it's cute, but no way in hell would she be taken seriously. Think like \"Princess\" or \"Honey\" for a name, while her middle is more \"professional\". It was her choice.\n\nNothing bad, just if people see a married couple running a company together, they defer to the man. I've seen it happen to my colleagues and friends who are married and work in the same area/company. As my wife says, it's a stupid sexist thing, and there's no true way to prevent it from happening. So, we lie and separate our lives. It was easier for her as she had a maiden name, so that's the way we went with it. My wife is actually more educated than I am, but that won't matter. People will assume she only \"got the job\" as she is my wife, forgetting the fact that we're equal partners and she started the company first.\n\nBasically, the benefit is that my wife gets the respect he deserves.", "author": "ThrowRAbadblackmail", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1768638709.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8048778772354126, "compound_score": -0.0655, "scores": {"negative": 0.1303, "neutral": 0.8049, "positive": 0.0648}}}, {"comment": {"id": "nzu4z5l", "post_id": "1qe1i9v", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "body": "Wow lmfao.

The only thing I want to add for OP is this: **Leave your \"what-ifs\" at the door.**\n\nIt’s easy to spiral into thoughts like:\n\n* \"What if he’s been lying about being gay this whole time?\"\n\n* \"What if they’ve been sneaking around since they were 13?\"\n\n* \"What if she’s sleeping with other people?\"\n\nIn reality, it's a normal part of development for teens to experiment with sex, including gay teens experimenting with heterosexual intercourse. Statistics show that a majority of gay and lesbian individuals have heterosexual experiences, often before or while they are coming to terms with their identity. For a teen who already knows he’s gay, this is often what's referred to as an \"identity-behaviour gap\"—a way to test social norms or seek \"social camouflage\" with a person they already deeply trust (in this case, your daughter).\n\nBecause they are best friends, they likely felt safe enough with each other to explore these confusing things together. This doesn't mean his identity was a lie, or that your daughter is sexually active beyond that one encounter; it often means they were using a safe relationship to learn more about themselves, and each other.\n\nWhen you talk to your daughter, keep these three caveats in mind:\n\n* Cool down: You feel betrayed because you thought he was \"safe.\" This is perfectly normal, but you need to process that anger away from her so you can lead with a rational demeanour.\n\n* Ask, don’t accuse: Your ultimate goal is to understand their dynamic, not to catch them in a lie.\n\n* Verify consent: This is the most important part. Ensure that consent for the encounter was mutual and free of pressure from either side.\n\nLastly, as a widower, don't feel like you have to carry the heavy talk alone. If there’s a trusted woman in your lives—an aunt, a grandmother, or a close family friend—she might be a helpful bridge for your daughter to feel more comfortable discussing the more nuanced or intimate side of this.\n\nEither way, it’s clear that you’re doing the work to stay in her life and support her, rather than pushing her away, and that’s what matters most.

Usually, almost always, parents of that older generation bought big older farm style homes. Set aside a portion for the paralyzed person.

Almost all of them the parent left the house in a trust - the paralyzed person could live out their life, then the home goes to whatever sibling willing to take care.  Not always direct physical care, a live in attendant can do that.  But there has to be a competent adult to manage it.  Because with paid help there will always be days when they don't come for whatever reason.  The one i remember most lived in parental home alone, with 12 hour caregivers (paid by medicaid because he was on a ventilator). The other 12 hours?  3 siblings lived nearby with their own families. The 3 siblings took turns coming to spend the night. They would be there in their pajamas in a twin bed in the same room as the patient when i left. So their actual involvement? 2-3 nights per week.

This should be # 1, closely followed by therapy for you and your wife. Or, at least some sort of grief/caregiver/parents of children with disabilities support group. \n\nHer disability is being treated like it turned her incapable of a happy, independent life. Or semi-independent, bare minimum. Has she had OT? I’m not saying it will magically happen or be easy. It will be *hard*, but worth fighting for. It will be setbacks and struggles, because progress is steady and slow. ‘Healing’ is not linear. \n\nI worry that you and your wife’s belief that she can do nothing has incapacitated her in some ways. Certainly, she has her own issues to work through, too. Seemingly, depression. But if she is getting the message that she cant do anything on her own, from her parents, how will she have the confidence to give anything a try? Humans are very good at internalizing messages from people around them—just because you don’t verbalize something, doesn’t mean you aren’t making your thoughts clear. You guys need to be encouraging as much independence as possible. She will probably have to work with OT to gain additional agency, but, even now, there are things she can do. If she has a working arm, why are other people doing her makeup and hair? \n\nCan she get into a disability support group? Or follow people on social media with similar injuries? I think some hope for the future is necessary right now. Maybe seeing other disabled people living happy, fulfilling lives can offer that. \n\nFinally, OP, I’m very sorry you all are in this position.

But my mom struggled with addiction to methamphetamines and dabbled in opiates. I was fortunate in that my mom recognized her problem and gave primary custody of my brother and I to my dad. But, addiction has long reaching tendrils, and I witnessed plenty of it first hand for many years. It’s a trauma that weaves into your very being, and the pain goes deep.\n\nYou are seeing it with open eyes, though. You see what’s happening, what effect it’s having on everything around you, and are taking the right steps for your sister, who is too young to really understand. I cannot overstate how proud I am of you for this clarity at 18yo. But I also know just how painful it is, because it requires you to fully acknowledge that your mom has failed you and your sister as a parent. \n\nIt is normal to have second thoughts about these upcoming steps with CPS, because it shines a hard light on what might feel shameful or embarrassing. It’s okay to feel these things, but it’s imperative to keep in mind two things. One, that it’s not you that is responsible for these feelings, but your mom. Her illness is still her responsibility to handle, and her failure to do so has harmed her children. Two, bringing the problem to the attention of authorities is not you hurting your family, no matter what your extended family may say. This move is about shielding your sister from further harm, and  bringing her life some stability. Your family should want that more than “saving face.” If they don’t see it that way, that is their issue, and do not allow them to turn it around on you.\n\nMy DMs are open if you need to talk to someone who also dealt with an addict mom as a kid and young adult. My mom is clean now, after a long struggle that almost took her life at least twice, but I still bear the metaphorical scars from the years before she got sober. I also strongly, strongly recommend therapy, or at least looking up a friends and family of addicts group (Al Anon, SMART Recovery Friends & Family, etc. Being around and/or talking to others who have felt what you felt can be a relief in its own right.\n\nGood luck, and keep your head on straight.

I said \"yeah but they were young once, they've been together since they were teenagers, I'm sure they indulged then\". To which mum replied that was impossible, as oral sex had only been \"invented\" in the late sixties by her generation, so anyone who was already an adult by the mid 1960s would never have known about it. \n\nShe truly believed that it had never happened prior to that. I told her that people having been licking each other's genitals for hundreds and probably thousands of years, but she refused to believe me, she kept saying that before the era of hippies and Free Love, sex was something that people did in the dark, under the covers, once a week and totally without any kind of foreplay.
