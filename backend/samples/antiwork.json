Federal immigration agents, backed by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tactical units, have already arrested more than 3,000 residents in sweeping operations that have targeted entire neighborhoods, workplaces and schools. The repression has provoked weeks of protests, high school walkouts and community demonstrations across Minnesota.\n\n>In response, a coalition of unions and community organizations called for a city-wide “day of action” on Friday, urging residents to participate in “no work, no school, no shopping.” Workers interpreted the call as a general strike to use the power of the working class to shut down economic activity and oppose state repression.\n\n>However, the trade union apparatus has moved swiftly to suppress any independent action by workers. Teamsters Local 638, which has over 5,000 members in Minnesota and North Dakota, circulated a letter warning members that participation in a work stoppage would violate their labor agreements with the corporate bosses. “The collective bargaining agreement that applies to you includes a no-strike provision, so you are not legally permitted to strike,” the statement declared.\n\n>...\n\n>Another UPS inside worker spoke bluntly: “ICE needs to get the hell out of this city. Donald Trump needs to be locked up, and the key thrown away. Kristi Noem needs to be tried for murder. The entire Homeland Security is a fraudulent joke. Get out of our state, ICE.”\n\n>Asked about the Teamsters’ opposition to strike action, he said, “Frankly I don’t agree with the Teamster leadership, I’m not a fan of Sean O’Brien. He’s turned his back on the Teamsters and doesn’t care. He’s a big backer of Trump. I said two years ago during our contract negotiations that he wasn’t for us, that we were going to get screwed on this contract. And we did get screwed in 2023. O’Brien doesn’t care about anybody but making his pocket richer. Now, UPS is cutting thousands of jobs.”\n\n>The anger expressed by workers is rooted in concrete experience. The Teamsters’ sellout of the 2023 national UPS contract paved the way for mass layoffs and restructuring. In 2025 alone, UPS eliminated roughly 48,000 jobs. This year, another 20,000 job cuts are expected as United Parcel Service accelerates plans to close nearly 200 facilities through 2028, consolidating smaller operations into massive, highly automated regional hubs. These changes are being imposed to boost profits and productivity, while workers, with the complicity of the Teamsters bureaucracy, pay the price through job losses, speedup and intensified exploitation.\n\n>Responding to the bipartisan backing for repression, including the Congressional Democrats support for a bill that would provide $10 billion to ICE, the worker added, “That’s why I’m not for either one of these parties. I’m all for workers and everybody uniting against this corrupt administration.”\n\n>...\n\n>The growing militancy among UPS workers underscores a central lesson of the unfolding struggle: The defense of democratic rights cannot be entrusted to the pro-corporate union bureaucracy or either of the two big business parties. What is required is the independent mobilization of the working class.\n\n>UPS and other workers must form rank-and-file committees, independent of the union apparatus, to democratically determine their own course of action, link up with workers across Minneapolis and nationally, and wield the enormous social power of the working class, not only on Friday, January 23, but in a sustained struggle against repression, layoffs and dictatorship.", "author": "Spirited_Classic_826", "score": 7128, "num_comments": 180, "created_utc": 1769090018.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qjv43j/ups_workers_back_minneapolis_general_strike/", "url": "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/22/wcgj-j22.html"}, {"id": "1qwzt78", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "Job asked us not to attend anti ICE protests", "selftext": "I work for a pretty big medical company in Minnesota with lots of people from other countries. \n\nThey had been silent for awhile about ICE until they couldn’t ignore it any longer when they had a meeting with everyone about what to do if they showed up at our company. \n\nThis week we had another meeting where management begged us not to attend any anti ICE protests downtown in an effort to avoid putting the company in a spotlight.\n\nI had to point out that these fuckers are all over the metro area, including damn near the Iowa and Canadian borders.

The union apparatus, closely tied to the Democratic Party, is attempting to counteract a growing sympathy for a general strike that is taking hold among broad layers of the population.\n\n>However, the very fact that the general strike has entered political discussion is itself an expression of a new stage in the class struggle and the social and political polarization of the United States. It reflects a growing sense within the working class that traditional political channels—court challenges, appeals to politicians, electoral maneuvers and pressure campaigns—are incapable of halting the rapid turn toward dictatorship.\n\n>At the immediate level, the call for a general strike in Minnesota is a response to the dramatic escalation of repression by the Trump administration and ICE in Minneapolis and other cities. What began as mass raids and sweeps targeting immigrant workers has developed into paramilitary deployments and the occupation of a major US city. This assault has stripped away all democratic pretenses, signaled Trump’s threat  to invoke extraordinary powers, including the Insurrection Act, and deploy the military against the population. \n\n>Trump’s response to opposition is to escalate. The murder of Renée Good has been followed by a wave of repression, further deployments and threats against protesters for engaging in “insurrection” and “terrorism.” On Friday, the Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, issuing subpoenas on the fraudulent charge that they “impeded” federal immigration enforcement, an extraordinary use of the justice system against elected officials.\n\n>There are, however, broader issues involved. The United States has reached a point where the scale of political breakdown and the ferocity of class tensions are generating profound shifts in consciousness. The Trump administration, speaking and acting for the capitalist oligarchy, is dismantling democratic rights and tearing up what remains of public education, healthcare and other social services. Workers face an AI-driven jobs bloodbath, soaring inflation and deepening debt, while US billionaires increased their collective wealth by 18 percent last year alone, to nearly $7 trillion. \n\n>...\n\n>**Minneapolis itself has a long history of class conflict. The 1934 Minneapolis truck drivers’ strike, led by Trotskyist workers in Teamsters Local 574, transformed a local organizing drive into a citywide general strike that paralyzed commerce and confronted the combined forces of the employers, police, National Guard, Farmer–Labor Party and Roosevelt administration. Its victory helped spark the mass industrial unionization of the 1930s and remains a powerful demonstration of what the working class can achieve when it fights under its own leadership and with a clear political perspective.**\n\n>...\n\n>The perspective of the Socialist Equality Party and the International Committee of the Fourth International has always emphasized the revolutionary role of the American working class as a decisive component of the international working class. \n\n>The SEP has fought consistently against all efforts to subordinate workers to the Democratic Party and its affiliated organizations. Through the initiation of the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC), the ICFI has developed the organizational form for a rebellion against the pro-corporate trade union apparatus. And most recently, the ICFI and WSWS has launched [Socialism AI](https://socialismai.com/) as a vital tool for the political education of workers and youth in the great lessons of the 20th and 21st centuries, above all, the strategic experiences of the Marxist movement.\n\n>In the actions of the Trump regime, the American oligarchy is crossing a Rubicon, from which there is no turning back. The issue confronting millions of workers and young people is the most fundamental: socialism or barbarism.\n\n>The *World Socialist Web Site* urges all working people who want to stop the descent into fascism and war, who want to fight for a future based on equality, democracy and peace, to draw the necessary conclusions and join the SEP. ", "author": "Spirited_Classic_826", "score": 4997, "num_comments": 71, "created_utc": 1768661600.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qff6pj/the_minnesota_general_strike_and_the_reemergence/", "url": "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/17/xcxi-j17.html"}, {"id": "1qnuvki", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "Bay Area tech workers ask CEOs to cancel ICE contracts", "selftext": "", "author": "sfgate", "score": 4829, "num_comments": 47, "created_utc": 1769465720.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qnuvki/bay_area_tech_workers_ask_ceos_to_cancel_ice/", "url": "https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/tech-workers-ice-petition-21316442.php"}, {"id": "1r4qmt4", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "This isn’t perfect economics but it captures why so many of us are burned out", "selftext": "", "author": "Alarmed_Abalone_849", "score": 4537, "num_comments": 42, "created_utc": 1771090457.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1r4qmt4/this_isnt_perfect_economics_but_it_captures_why/", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ap6qhfu1xhjg1.jpeg"}, {"id": "1qsiz7r", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "Labor Unions Are Banding Together And Rallying Against ICE", "selftext": "", "author": "JoeyZasaa", "score": 4483, "num_comments": 49, "created_utc": 1769905021.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qsiz7r/labor_unions_are_banding_together_and_rallying/", "url": "https://labor411.org/411-blog/labor-unions-are-rallying-against-ice/"}, {"id": "1qlnz33", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "New York Times documents ICE’s violent tactics in Minnesota", "selftext": "", "author": "Meg_anKathleen", "score": 4320, "num_comments": 333, "created_utc": 1769263878.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qlnz33/new_york_times_documents_ices_violent_tactics_in/", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/24/us/minnesota-ice-violence-tactics-videos.html"}, {"id": "1r0g3tt", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "Suspended Ford Factory Worker Who Heckled Trump Last Month Will Keep His Job: UAW", "selftext": "", "author": "thedailybeast", "score": 4306, "num_comments": 50, "created_utc": 1770670142.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1r0g3tt/suspended_ford_factory_worker_who_heckled_trump/", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/ford-defies-trump-afterthomas-tj-sabula-heckled-president-donald-trump/"}, {"id": "1qy2hwg", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "Prove them wrong and We Win", "selftext": "50 years ago, your job came with a pension, a union card, and a future.

The march and rally were warmly received by passersby and community members, many of whom honked horns and raised their fists in support.\n\n>The rally began at a local post office and ended in front of the memorial where Renée Nicole Good, a mother and wife, was murdered by Jonathan Ross, a Department of Homeland Security agent, less than two weeks ago. Signs carried by workers at the rally denounced Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for not doing anything to stop the ongoing attacks on the community.\n\n>The protest was organized by the Build a Fighting NALC (BFN), a faction of the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC). BFN organizers made clear to WSWS reporters that Sunday’s event was not in support of the proposed January 23 general strike and boycott that several unions have endorsed.\n\n>Instead, the demands advanced at Sunday’s event were narrowly focused on calls to prevent ICE agents from staging their vehicles on United States Postal Service (USPS) property before heading out on kidnapping operations. Other demands included calls for the prosecution of Ross for the murder of Good and for ICE agents to leave the Twin Cities and Minnesota.\n\n>**However, in conversations with WSWS reporters, many workers and residents said they would support postal workers, and every section of the working class, going on strike not only in Minnesota but across the country.**\n\n>**...**\n\n>Nikki, a worker and mother, told the WSWS, “We need to show our solidarity because the only people that are ‘winning’ right now are those that are profiting off of all of us.”\n\n>She added, “We are all working-class people that are being oppressed in one way or another.”\n\n>Nikki explained that she was born and raised in Gary, Indiana, and that her grandfather “worked in steel mills, so we were dyed in the wool union as long as I can remember.” She added, “This is just something that is in my blood, to organize and to have solidarity among regular people.”\n\n>She concluded, “By going on a general strike, we can really make it hurt in the only place they care, which is their pocket… So a general strike to me is the most effective thing we can do right now.”", "author": "Spirited_Classic_826", "score": 3268, "num_comments": 23, "created_utc": 1768842114.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qh9t21/students_and_workers_support_call_for_a_general/", "url": "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/19/ypoi-j19.html"}, {"id": "1qvyqzs", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "For those confused on auto rejections…", "selftext": "This is what it looks like when I post a job to auto-decline people that don’t meet the minimum.

There were also protests Tuesday in Wisconsin, Oklahoma, New York, Ohio, New Mexico, California, Kansas, Virginia and other states.\n\n>At a protest outside City Hall, Audry, a young Certified Nursing Assistant, told the WSWS, “I’d rather see my family and my community happy and safe than go out and get a paycheck. I don’t need to see people dying anymore. I don’t need to see my family and friends taken away. That’s not ok. I’m not going to work Friday. What Trump is doing is an act of terrorism. ICE are the real domestic terrorists,” she concluded.\n\n>A young retail worker taking part in a demonstration in front of the governor’s mansion said, “I’m opposed to the federal invasion of Minneapolis, people being slaughtered in our streets. We are here, letting our voices be heard, saying we are done with this. We are all coming together on Friday, a lot of people at my work, as many people as we can get for a general strike. We want to show that, we, the people, will not take it anymore.”\n\n>She pointed out the ICE arrest of a 17-year-old Target worker who, despite being an American citizen, was thrown into a truck, beaten and thrown out in a Walmart parking lot seven miles away, bloodied as can be. “The Walmart workers helped him; and now we all have to help each other.”\n\n>She added, “If we are not united as a working force, we have no power. The current political regimes of the Democrats and Republicans are not looking out for the people. They care more about their wealth than people being ripped from their homes and jobs.” \n\n>Addressing herself to workers across the country and the world, she said, “We all need to be as one, right now. This is a struggle that we are impacted by. If we don’t fight back now, it will be too late.”\n\n>**After a series of walkouts by high school students, the Minneapolis Public Schools announced that the district would be closed on Friday for “teacher record-keeping day.” A student at Irondale High School told the WSWS, “Students organized a lot of walkouts.** I’m Latino, so most of my family is a little worried, and I know a lot of people who are severely affected by it. They’ve been inside since it all started. They have their kids going, getting groceries for them. They’re not allowed to go outside. They haven’t been going to work. It’s a terrible thing.”\n\n>...\n\n>The situation in Minneapolis poses urgent strategic questions. Workers cannot allow their struggle to be strangled by bureaucratic obstruction. The fight against ICE repression, state violence and authoritarianism requires independent organization and leadership.\n\n>Rank-and-file workers must demand mass meetings in workplaces, schools and neighborhoods to democratically decide their own course of action not just on January 23 but beyond. Committees independent of the union bureaucracy should be formed to coordinate action across industries and cities, linking the fight in Minneapolis with workers nationally and internationally.\n\n>The defense of democratic rights is inseparable from the struggle against capitalism itself. The same ruling class that wages war abroad and enriches itself through exploitation is now deploying paramilitary forces and troops against the population at home.\n\n>Minneapolis workers and youth are confronting not merely an abusive administration but the advanced decay of American democracy.

I literally do the exact job they're advertising.\n\nI brought it up to my manager this morning trying to stay calm about it and he got all defensive saying \"thats the market rate for new hires\" and \"we cant adjust everyones salary every time we post a new position.\" Like what?? So you're telling me someone walking in off the street with zero knowledge of our systems is worth 15k more than me who literally trained the last two people in this role?\n\nThey've been saying for months theres no room in the budget for raises. I have money from Stakе saved up in case something like this happened but I didnt think it would actually be this bad.\n\nI'm done.

I read the posts here once in a while to see what I can do to keep my employees happy.\n\nOne of the things I've done every year is a salary survey.  I hire a firm to survey similar businesses in my area to see what average wages are for the positions I need.  I've always targeted paying about 40% above market average, because that gets me high quality employees (and for 10 years or so  it's allowed me to recruit great people solely through word of mouth).\n\nIn a typical year I find I'm right in my target range.  But this year? I just got the survey and it turns out I'm paying 113% above the geographic average.  Not because I gave everybody big raises... it's because similar firms are paying less than they have in the past.  About 35% less than last year!\n\nI'm trying to figure out what's going on.  My guesses so far:\n\na) businesses like mine are being bought up by venture capital folks (I've turned down multiple offers) who are trying to squeeze every penny out of a place that they can\n\nb) businesses are fearing an economic downturn, so they're not willing to spend on new hires (and are telling the survey taker what they'd pay for a new employee rather than a current one)\n\nc) when they lose employees they're getting lots of applicants, so they can hire for less, and they do\n\nJust curious if there might be other reasons I haven't thought of.\n\nUPDATE: wow this got a lot of traction.  Rather than answer each comment I'll answer here:\n\n\\- several people have asked both here in in DMs what the survey methodology is.  The firm I use contacts business owners/HR departments, assures them anonymity, and provides them with the survey results if they participate (what they get as an average doesn't include my firm, as I'm not a survey respondent).  They do a reality check of the responses by looking at job postings in the area for the last three years. I do my own sanity check by calling a couple of people I know who work in the field - I don't ask for specific numbers (to avoid even the hint of collusion) but general stuff - did they get raises this year?  Lots of new hires? etc.\n\n\\- one person suggested the money I spend on the survey would be better spent on my employees.  I disagree, and here's why: For every $1000 spent on a survey I'd only be able to give employees a little more than $900, because whatever I pay requires the business to pay into social security and medicare, it could increase what I have to spend on federal and state unemployment taxes depending on when people are hired, and it increases workman's comp insurance costs, because all of those are based on payroll.  Divide that by 13 employees and we're in the $70 range.  It'd come out to about $1.30/week/person, out of which they'd also be paying into social security, medicare, and state and federal taxes.  A buck a week more in their pockets is more of an insult than a reward IMO.  Spending on the survey gives me information that I can use for strategic decisions that can ultimately benefit all of us.\n\n\\- we have open books.  Every employee knows what everyone else makes\n\n\\- our competitors do seem to have high turnover.  We have essentially zero - my two newest employees have been with me five years now.  I've had two previous employees leave to pursue grad schools, and a half dozen or so leave because their spouses took jobs out of state.  Other than that, people stay.\n\n\\- we don't do profit sharing because I honestly think it's a poor way to compensate.  Things happen that are beyond our control: during covid I had to borrow considerable sums to keep the business afloat, so no profit that year.  Ongoing debt service while I pay that down has impacted the bottom line since.  To my mind a higher steady income is a better way to compensate than a lower paycheck with a periodic and fluctuating bonus", "author": "looking4euterpe", "score": 2320, "num_comments": 110, "created_utc": 1770932352.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1r36bsc/holy_crap_wage_survey/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1r36bsc/holy_crap_wage_survey/"}, {"id": "1qla363", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "More than 40 US Democrats call for a 'thorough investigation' of EA's Saudi-led buyout over risks of layoffs, studio closures, and 'coordinated anti-labor practices'", "selftext": "", "author": "esporx", "score": 2280, "num_comments": 63, "created_utc": 1769220039.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qla363/more_than_40_us_democrats_call_for_a_thorough/", "url": "https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/more-than-40-us-democrats-call-for-a-thorough-investigation-of-eas-saudi-led-buyout-over-risks-of-layoffs-studio-closures-and-coordinated-anti-labor-practices/"}, {"id": "1r0bb8s", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "They made me believe I was in line for a promotion for 6 months to make me work extra when they already promised the position to my colleague", "selftext": "Six months ago my manager went on parental leave and I was put in his role.

The exposed wires, plumbing problems, and pest problems took up about a 3rd and were more widespread than I thought but food, security and sanitation problems are rampant and they found patterns of repeated injury denial of staff something I had personal experience with after being forced to return and work with a serious injury and they refused to provide reasonable accommodations. \n\n After I told my mom she said she heard about it on the local news.

Your rights will remain with you until you realize they have left. Your life will stay calm and peaceful, until it isn't.\n\nMany people say that nothing can be done or that any action is futile. If this is the case, your action is further demanded. If change is impossible, then there is an insufficient degree of effort being applied. There is power in collective action. You are already being watched. You are already being threatened. You are already being killed. Believing that ineffectiveness justifies inaction makes you like cattle, undisturbed by seeing those in front of you in line get slaughtered.\n\nYou have a duty to protect the rights of the citizenry, not merely your own comfort. The alienation of any person's rights is an alienation of your own, merely delayed by distance, demographic, laziness, or cowardice. I've seen the \"and then there was no one to speak for me\" poem posted more times than I can count and yet there seems this bizarre unearned comfort that sharing the words of someone else is sufficient action of your own. It is not.\n\nYour rights and personhood are threatened. Start building a wall around them and stand guard against their siege. **This does not mean to be violent** or that the only action is street-level protesting. Not all action need be so direct or public to be effective. Many of you possess skill sets through work, hobbies, or other life experience. Make use of them.\n\nIf you need a few examples to get your bearings, have some:\n\n* **Software engineering**: My field and avenue of action. Many of you are builders. I've seen great things be built and amass wealth for many of those who now seek your oppression. Build something new that helps. Work together with your network. Make it open source with a clear mission statement and avenue for contribution. Leverage the AI that would displace you to build the tools that will ensure your protection. What am I doing? Working on a modern unionizing and striking platform; I will be looking for contributors once a workable baseline is reached.\n* **Educators**: You shape the minds of the rising change agents. You have a wide array of useful knowledge: how to compose a good argument, what the true history of something is, how to analyze media and think critically about it, and how to test and retest the falsifiable claims presented to you. Teach these skills to anyone who will give you their time, beyond just your students. Make a concerted, deliberate effort with an explicit invitation of learning. Have uncomfortable conversations; they are how people grow. Or use the skills directly: document, blog, philosophize, research.\n* **Trades & logistics**: You have power over our material world. By action, you can make things function. By inaction, you may cause them to fall apart. Build shelters for your community. Contribute materials to protests to build signs or platforms. Teach others the basics of your trade so that they might be independently productive. Many of you are unionized. Teach your fellow union members the hard-won, historically grounded benefits of unionization. Show them that anti-union is anti-them. Encourage them that their abilities, if withheld, can cripple a system no longer working for them.\n* **Medical professionals**: Provide care to harmed protesters. Teach first aid to them. Encourage new or strengthened policies at your place of work to protect groups you know to be vulnerable. Many of you took the Hippocratic Oath. When an environment becomes sufficiently hostile, a lack of care becomes harm.\n* **Legal professionals**: You know how THE system works and that proper engagement with it can be difficult and costly. Provide services (pro bono or merely affordable) to those in need. Teach others about their rights and how to best protect them. Consult with organizers on which actions are legally available and those that are not. Contribute your efforts to specializations that may not be your expertise and accept potentially needed humility in the available work. Observe the systems that are under attack and make the attacks known and digestible for those without your expertise.\n* **Those with “boring” office jobs**: you know how groups function. Organization, accounting, and large scale systems are necessary for large movements. Find one and move. If you are able, leverage the slow processes you hate to disempower the policies you know to be immoral. Quiet-quitting is not a pejorative or merely a tool to use when unappreciated. It is a fundamental unit of dissent.\n* **Those with money but little time**: Fund those that possess the time you do not. Enable the charities, aid groups, or your own network that show they are working towards a tomorrow you want to see. If money is now speech, make your voice heard.  \n* **Those with only a phone**: Call politicians and demand you be heard. Record those violating your rights. Shame those who support that violation; the discomfort is imposed by their violation of your rights, not you calling it out. Serve on the suicide hotline. Volunteer for outreach programs for politicians you favor.

We had one earlier in the week that left 8 inches of snow and additional ice which has yet to melt at all and barely any of it has been removed from our local roads and parking lots. Yesterday we had another blizzard which left us with even more snow. The roads are in terrible condition,  many people have been unable to get out of their houses and every day commuting is very hazardous especially for people who live on back roads and away from town. \n\n  \nObviously in light of that, some people have not been able to make it to work at the restaurant I manage.

I think it's fine and frankly we're not getting much business anyway -- yesterday we only made $2000, a typical day usually nets us between $8000 to $10000. That's been all week. \n\n  \nMy upper management however finds any absences or lateness completely unacceptable during all this.  Yesterday DURING the blizzard our GM told one person that \"there's nothing wrong with walking\" when she informed him her car was stuck and she couldn't come in. She lives three miles away. I asked if he had ever had to walk to work in weather like this and he saud he's never had to walk to work at all. Our supervisor has said if she can come in, no one else has an excuse -- she lives along a major highway,  one of the few roads to have been salted and scraped, and has a weather appropriate vehicle.  \n\n  \nAgain,  we are making virtually no money this week.

Management has described the moves as “right-sizing” after the company’s beef segment posted a large loss in fiscal year 2025. Framed as a business necessity, the decision will in fact be a social catastrophe for workers and entire communities.\n\n>The human and regional consequences are immediate and severe. Lexington is a town of roughly 11,000 people, and the plant’s closure will directly affect a large share of local employment, with ripple effects across housing, retail, services, and public revenues. A 2024 U.S. Census Bureau report shows that 10.9 percent of Nebraskans live below the poverty line. Food insecurity stands at 11.6 percent, according to [SpotlightOnPoverty.org](http://SpotlightOnPoverty.org), while the state minimum wage remains a meager $9 an hour.\n\n>Modeling by the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and local estimates suggest total job losses in the regional economy could approach 7,000. Tyson workers alone stand to lose an estimated $241 million in annual pay and benefits. Jason Douglas, CEO of the Lexington Regional Health Center, described the closure as a “spreadsheet decision,” warning that the community could be left with a hollowed-out, unusable facility. He pointed to the long and damaging aftermath of earlier shutdowns in the state, including job cuts by U.S. Cellular Corporation, layoffs at food safety firm Fortrex in Lexington, and reductions at Neenah Foundry in Lincoln and Eaton Corporation in Kearney.\n\n>These cuts follow the 2024 closure of the Tyson Foods pork plant in Perry, Iowa, outside Des Moines, with the loss of 1,200 jobs.\n\n>...\n\n>In response to mass layoffs and the broader assault on public health, the United Food and Commercial Workers union has taken no action. It has neither called strikes nor organized coordinated mobilizations against the destruction of livelihoods. This inaction reflects the deep integration of union bureaucracies into corporate management and the state, where concessions are routinely accepted at workers’ expense.\n\n>The Tyson layoffs are part of a broader, global assault on jobs, democratic rights, and living standards. In the United States, this offensive finds one of its sharpest expressions in the policies of the Trump administration, which has encountered no serious opposition from the Democratic Party.\n\n>What is needed is the construction of democratic, rank-and-file led organizations and a political strategy that links workplace struggles to wider social demands. Immediate steps include forming independent shop-floor committees, holding fully democratic meetings, and organizing opposition to restructuring plans outside the control of pro-corporate union officials. These committees must build solidarity across plants and communities, coordinating strikes, pickets, mutual aid and broader campaigns to defend jobs and living standards.", "author": "Spirited_Classic_826", "score": 1301, "num_comments": 57, "created_utc": 1769260263.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qlmlrd/brutal_tyson_foods_restructuring_leaves_nearly/", "url": "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/24/qdaa-j24.html"}, {"id": "1r2u9jz", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "If You’re a Real Person Looking for a Job, the Flood of Fake AI Job Applications Will Make Your Blood Boil", "selftext": "Beneath the official jobs data is a growing accessibility crisis.

Enough to shut me up and really second guess bringing it up again. \n\nI finally had enough and filed an official wage complaint against my employer about a month ago. When my boss flat out ignored the new state laws and minimums for salary. \n\nMy employer was notified this week and the reaction has been less than stellar to say the least. I was confronted immediately, and to no surprise - it’s not been going well. Each party has received notification from the state but it can take up to another 120-140 days before a case worker is assigned. \n\nI gave so much of myself to this company for many years. I would shave time off my monthly hours, like an idiot I’d tell myself that I’m being a team player. I’m helping the company and it will come back to me eventually. I worked off the clock, used my personal assets and vehicles. I would spend countless hours at night working on various projects and social media. \n\nUpon receiving notification, my employer has done all he possibly can to make my life miserable. The slurry of new rules and policies. I used to work the hours that worked for me and my family. Never mind the fact I was working 9,10, and even up to 14 hours a day. I am now subject to a very strict schedule. I have been placed on a performance improvement plan. Which is ironic considering I have a plethora of text messages and emails with tons of praise for me. How I’m doing a great job, how I’ve come such a long way in the evolving role I am in. How my moral compass and standards are like nothing they’ve ever seen. How they were so proud of me.  My employer is installing cameras this week, to watch me closely as now he does not trust me. Suddenly new drug testing policies are being implemented. No pets or dogs allowed anymore, but for the last several years it was encouraged to have your dog with you at work. Other staff in leadership roles expressed their love for the office dog. So many new policies aimed specifically at me. \n\nMy employer has a reputation for anger issues. Lashing out over small and insignificant things. Then I learned he is injecting testosterone. Over the years I have been able to identify the weeks where he would be on the upswing and to avoid him and anything negative. Knowing that in a week or two he would be on the downswing and more lethargic and easier to speak to altogether.  \n\nI’ve realized I let this go on for far too long. For too many years I went along with the program thinking I was doing what’l was right. Simultaneously I have watched this man use people up and when they have nothing more to offer him, he casts them aside. A real conman.  Wants everything for free. Thinks he should not have to pay full price for anything, yet thinks the world should pay TOP DOLLAR for anything he’s selling. He displays narcissistic tendencies and his ego is so inflated. He needs people to constantly kiss his ass. He needs to feel important so he hires women he meets at his gym. They set his schedule and make his zoom appointments for him. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn if he has them cut up his meals for him. \n\nOnce upon a time, this man had a very successful business.

According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which produces the widely-cited monthly report on layoffs, hiring levels also fell to their lowest point since the firm began tracking the data in 2009. January’s layoffs were more than double the total recorded in the same month last year and triple the level announced in December.\n\n>In 2025, US companies announced more than 1.2 million layoffs, the highest level since 2020, the first year of the pandemic. The figures for the first month of 2026 already indicate that the pace of job destruction is accelerating into the new year.\n\n>The wave of layoffs is part of a global jobs bloodbath, driven by a ruthless global search for new sources of profit to sustain uncontrollable levels of debt and financial bubbles on which the wealth of the oligarchy rests. The other side of this global war on the working class is imperialist plunder, expressed in the attack on Venezuela and the impending attack on Iran.\n\n>Among the largest announcements, Amazon announced 16,000 job cuts last month, concentrated in corporate and technology positions. UPS, now entering the third year of a vast restructuring program, announced plans to eliminate 30,000 additional jobs on top of the 48,000 already cut since last year. UPS and Amazon alone accounted for nearly half of all layoffs announced in January.\n\n>...\n\n>Among industrial workers, the largest sections affected so far are in logistics, where the introduction of new autonomous robotics threatens to eliminate almost all in-warehouse jobs. In that sector, some 95,000 jobs were cut last year.\n\n>Other industries experiencing steep declines include the auto industry, where 32,000 layoffs were carried out last year alone in response to lower-than-expected sales of electric vehicles.\n\n>In healthcare, more than 17,000 layoffs were announced last month, the highest level since the start of the pandemic in 2020. This is particularly significant as 46,000 nurses and other healthcare workers are currently on strike on both coasts of the United States. These workers are being driven into struggle not only in defense of jobs and pay, but over safe staffing levels and the well-being of patients.\n\n>A tremendous upsurge of class struggle is already beginning in the United States in response to the impossible economic situation confronting workers and the oligarchic dictatorship of Trump. Demands for a general strike, initially raised in protests against ICE murders in Minneapolis, will only grow over the course of the year.\n\n>A significant aspect of the mass layoffs is their concentration among middle-class professionals. This represents a dramatic and extremely rapid reversal for some of the few sections of the workforce that were able to maintain a relatively decent standard of living in recent years.\n\n>...\n\n>A massive speculative bubble has developed around artificial intelligence, which one economist has described as 17 times larger than the dot-com bubble of 2000 and four times the real estate bubble that produced the Great Recession. Actual cost savings from AI deployment are reportedly developing far slower than anticipated, and may take years to fully realize. Nevertheless, vast sums continue to pour into the sector, with $1.6 trillion invested in new data centers and AI startups through 2024, and an estimated $375 billion more expected in 2025, according to Reuters.\n\n>The run-up on Wall Street has enriched a tiny layer at the top, with US billionaires increasing their combined wealth by $1.5 trillion last year. At the same time, it is laying the groundwork for a massive financial crisis in the near future that will far exceed the crash of 2008–09. The rise in gold prices indicates that this crisis is already calling into question the viability of the dollar and the credibility of US government debt.\n\n>These shocks will produce, and already are producing, profound political consequences that are forcing a radicalization of the population, not only among workers but also among substantial sections of the middle class. The growing demands for a general strike among protests have not yet acquired a distinctly working class character. Increasingly, these layers are turning toward the working class for leadership in the fight against capitalist exploitation.\n\n>This underscores the decisive importance of conscious preparations for a mass movement by the working class, acting as an independent and leading force against mass layoffs, austerity and the broader assault on democratic and social rights.", "author": "Spirited_Classic_826", "score": 1168, "num_comments": 17, "created_utc": 1770389030.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qxjglj/layoffs_by_us_firms_tripled_in_january_as_mass/", "url": "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/02/06/xgpp-f06.html"}, {"id": "1qv774i", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "Hired as mostly-remote, now told “5 days in-office starting today” via 5am screenshot", "selftext": "Started Aug 2025 at a small, old, family-run business.

The company had documented four previous failures of the same component on three different aircraft but concluded the defect would not create a safety hazard.\n\n>The NTSB investigative update provides damning evidence that both Boeing and UPS possessed knowledge of a recurring mechanical failure years before the disaster, yet took no meaningful action to prevent it. The crash of UPS Flight 2976 on November 4, 2025, which killed three crew members and 11 people on the ground, was entirely preventable.\n\n>The NTSB report states that the spherical bearing race, a critical component securing the left engine to the wing, fractured completely during takeoff. Laboratory examination found that fatigue cracks had formed around the entire circumference of the bearing’s interior surface, ultimately encompassing 75 percent of the fracture area before final over-stress failure occurred.\n\n>This type of progressive fatigue cracking does not develop overnight. The bearing had been experiencing cyclic stresses over an extended period, gradually weakening until catastrophic failure during the takeoff roll.\n\n>The most damning revelation in the NTSB report concerns Boeing Service Letter MD-11-SL-54-104-A, issued in February 2011. This document informed operators that the same type of bearing had failed four times previously on three different MD-11 aircraft. Each of these failures initiated at precisely the same location—the design recess groove on the interior surface of the bearing race—and resulted in the bearing splitting into two pieces.\n\n>Despite this pattern of repeated failures in a component that secures a multi-ton engine to the wing, Boeing determined that such failures would not result in a safety-of-flight condition. The company’s response was to recommend that the bearing be inspected during routine general visual inspections, typically conducted every 60 months.\n\n>...\n\n>The Democrats issued equally perfunctory statements, reflecting their subservience to Wall Street and major military contractors. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, appeared at press conferences expressing sympathy for victims while taking no action to hold Boeing or UPS accountable for the preventable deaths. This continues the policies of the Biden administration, which did not prosecute Boeing for the deaths of passengers and crew in the 737 MAX 8 crashes and intervened to block railroad workers from striking over safety concerns in 2022.\n\n>The fight for safe working conditions cannot be entrusted to corporations, regulatory agencies, or the union bureaucracy. Workers must organize independent rank-and-file committees to assert democratic control over safety inspections, maintenance schedules and operational decisions. These committees must be linked internationally through the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC) to coordinate the struggle against the systematic subordination of worker and community safety to private profit.\n\n>Disasters like the November Louisville air crash will continue as long as the aviation and logistics industries remain under the control of a corporate oligarchy concerned only with quarterly earnings and stock prices. The operation of these essential systems must be transferred to public ownership and placed under the democratic control of the working class as part of the fight for socialism.", "author": "Spirited_Classic_826", "score": 953, "num_comments": 21, "created_utc": 1768661386.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qff3l3/ntsb_report_reveals_boeing_knew_of_fatal_defect/", "url": "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2026/01/17/tvxk-j17.html"}, {"id": "1qq4klo", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "Stop charging your staff for food you cheap ass", "selftext": "", "author": "DukeOfGeek", "score": 945, "num_comments": 90, "created_utc": 1769680865.0, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/1qq4klo/stop_charging_your_staff_for_food_you_cheap_ass/", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-sSAk5ITmFY"}, {"id": "1qzcaoq", "subreddit": "antiwork", "title": "I asked r/NoStupidQuestions why US cashiers stand, and the answers are shocking to me.

I'm on staff at the school at the same location, but am currently on medical leave. Not being able to return to the school program this year has been devastating, but the thought of camp has left some hope. \n\nI have been receiving camp staff emails occasionally, as I had in previous years. No direct communication from the Camp Director, but that's expected at this point.  \n\nToday I received a group email that they are thrilled  all positions (except two unrelated) had been filled--what? I checked the website--I've been replaced by a former counselor I used to mentor.  No conversation. No communication. I've simply been cut out entirely. \n\nI suspect now that leaving me on the email chain all year was unintentional. \n\nI know on one level it's just business. I was considered unreliable because I had to be unexpectedly hospitalized for the last two weeks of camp last Summer. Maybe there's even an element of thinking I'm unsafe to work with kids because it was a psych hospitalization. Even well meaning and educated people can be incredibly ignorant and ableist. \n\nBut on the other hand, I did my job there for 2 years and did it very well. I always got perfect scores on my performance reviews. I didn't have any outbursts or anything. I always showed up and went above and beyond until I simply physically couldn't. I had to be hospitalized because a misdiagnosed neurological disorder was causing so much physical pain that it was making it hard to want to live. \n\nThe \"get well soon\" card they sent home with ny spouse when he picked up my stuff from camp feels different now. It was a goodbye card. Just took me 6 months to finally get the message. \n\nThe pill that is so difficult to swallow is the messaging in our culture to \"do what you have to do to take care of yourself\" and \"good job for choosing life\" \"I'm so proud of you for seeking help\" when people struggle with ideation, but then when you do you often get punished. Socially, financially, career-wise, in so many big and small ways. You are treated as dramatic, crazy, unreliable, weak, manipulative, or cut off entirely--all for surviving. This messaging comes from family, friends, partners, employers and coworkers, medical providers---especially psych providers.

It was one of the ways meant to essentially help curtail Medicare fraud. It spooked a lot of folks in the industry but my employer really freaked out- because as I found out later they likely were intentionally abusing this practice and basically committing fraud, probably. Company wide email goes out- they say we’re anticipating losing around $100million annually in reimbursements due to this new reg.\n\nMy team gets the assignment of figuring out how we make this documentation easy to capture- because the issue isn’t really that it’s a lot of documentation but that the admitting physician has to be the one to complete it, and it has to be done in a timely manner and physician compliance is simply a challenge sometimes- alot ofthose guys just do what they fucking want\n\nI figure out a way to do it- basically configure a warning in our EMR that’s super annoying and difficult for the doc to bypass under certain conditions, but also makes capturing this documentation a three click action. Plus, if they do the documentation in a timely manner it’s a one click action if they just remember to do it before we need to fire the warning. Finally, administration grew some balls and threatened physicians paychecks directly - basically if we find that we’re losing reimbursements we’re taking it out of your check. \n\nAfter just loads of finagling to get the thing working just right- we push it to production and it’s a huge success. The correct users are doing the correct things mostly, and the ones that aren’t are engaging with the warning. It becomes trivial to complete the documentation that satisfies this new reg, and compliance is unimaginably high. In fact it’s so high and so reliable, it ends up solving a second problem we were having with legitimate reimbursement claims being denied. \n\nAfter a year, we checked metrics against our projections. We didn’t lose $100 million. We didn’t lose anything. In fact, we boosted reimbursements by nearly $110 million. \n\nI got a pat on the back which like, whatever; I was more happy that jobs weren’t lost as a result of a huge dip in our reimbursements. \n\nAbout three months later my employer laid off around 1800 staff across all its locations. \n\nThe lesson I learned is that no amount of money is enough to stop capital from fucking workers if it means saving another dime.

It doesn't happen without organizational capacity and labor buy-in.\n\nCalls to action without organizing fail because there is no way to ensure follow-through. As Jane McAlevey explains in No Shortcuts (2018), we need to build long term power, center workers in decision making, not just have an ask by few leveraging digital connectivity and \"hope it works out.\"\n\nWe have a coalition building for May 1, 2026 (bit.ly/MayDay26) with experienced organizers and networks. Labor unions are also building toward 2028. If we urge a strike when most are too scared to even talk to coworkers about organizing or stand up to bosses, without a renewed labor movement or massive coalition behind it, it's not happening. Regular working people need the security that only comes from being organized, they won't risk jobs and housing without real power.\n\nSimilarly, folks talking about rising up or 2A stuff who haven't even joined a Rapid Response Network are indulging in fantasy of heroic movie-style action. If we can't do basic organizing, we won't pull off major actions. High attendance at permitted protests every few months, or online support, isn't indicative of long term capacity. Words are easy; action is hard.\n\n\nWe can largely fix this with **barnstorm recruitment** at No Kings rallies. We ask the crowd at peak excitement to take roles - organizing workplaces, tenant unions, or schools. The technique is starting with high-commitment asks where people come to the front for sign up and applause (social reward), then making progressively smaller asks. \n\nThis leverages social pressure because people want the reward before time runs out, and there are less excuses for smaller asks. Most people have simply never been asked directly to join, social media posts, emails, mass texts don't grab people like this does.\n\nThen maybe **465 district strategy**, instead of the current free for all where anyone can host their events or create indivisible groups, leading to cliques and biased leadership in less organized places. This wouldn't undo existing orgs and networks, but force them to work together to join a new program that inherently channels pressure from events towards Members of Congress who currently fly under the radar. \n\nAlso **targeting local electeds who don't stand up for our rights, or criticize admin**, who are more vulnerable to pressure than the White House is. They can place pressure on the admin and state leaders, yet currently comply. But nonprofits are averse to doing that directly targeted stuff because it slides into 501c4 lobbying/advocacy time, and many are 501c3 nonprofits.\n\nWe have the tools and answers, existing efforts, people simply aren't involved enough, plus structural (nonprofit legality) and cultural (clique leadership, differing norms) turns off regular working people.", "author": "Bocchi_theGlock", "score": 37, "created_utc": 1769381953.0}, {"id": "o1mifxo", "post_id": "1qmkvzr", "subreddit": "antiwork", "body": "Whatever mods removed that should be ashamed.
