In light of the Epstein files, it becomes clear that elites embrace the vices and behaviors they project onto migrants through their media influence and lobbied politicians. My point is - the criticisms leveraged against migrants are often literally embodied by the ultrawealthy.\n\n**1) Migrants are welfare queens <-> Ultrawealthy parasitism**  \nMigrants are net contributors, while the ultrawealthy massively exploit tax breaks and government subsidies.\n\n**2) Migrants are criminals <-> Ultrawealthy are criminals**  \nMigrants perform less crime than natives on average, while the ultrawealthy are notorious rapists, scammers, fraudsters, abusers, exploiters. Granted, the types of crime change, but they only change in scale and complexity.\n\n**3) Migrants don't pay taxes <-> Ultrawealthy tax evasion**  \nMigrants do pay their fair share of taxes, while the ultrawealthy do everything to avoid them by storing it in wealth, stocks and creative accounting, often allowed by taxing rules they lobbied for.\n\n**4) Migrants don't integrate <-> Ultrawealthy form insular elite networks**  \nUnless barred systematically or economically, migrants have little difficulty integrating into society. On the other hand, the rich are insular, forming parallel societies that considers itself superior to everyone else. Private schools, gated communities, global networks and socializing away from society on degenerate decadent parties (Including Epstein island), insulating themselves far away from social accountability.\n\n**5) Migrants are a cultural threat <-> Ultrawealthy erode culture**  \nMigrants are told to erode the culture they inhabit. By ownership or direct influence on most media and social media, it is the ultrawealthy that do so - shaping people's tastes, opinions on any subject, influencing their political opinions, all the way down to fashion and product tastes.\n\n**6) Migrants are a security threat <-> Ultrawealthy are a geopolitical threat**  \nMigrants are said to be an unsafe influence or presence, be it due to their suspected criminality or unsavory world views. Meanwhile, the ultrawealthy manipulate markets, lobby for conflicts and influence international policy for personal profit.\n\n**7) Migrants are lazy or unambitious <-> Ultrawealthy exploit labor**  \nMigrants are said to be unproductive, but in fact they work essential and often underpaid jobs. Meanwhile, the ultrawealthy sit on money-making stock or other wealth, delegating most work to others or taking credit for their achievements.\n\n**8) Migrants take jobs <-> Ultrawealthy exploit labor laws and push for AI**  \nMigrants don't actually take your job, often they fill an employment gap that otherwise wouldn't be filled. On the other hand, the ultrawealthy engage in union busting and work on reducing the amount of labor their wealth generation requires, potentially costing an average person's job.\n\n**9) Migrants are immoral or lack moral values <-> Ultrawealthy embrace decadence**  \nMigrants are not any more or less moral than any other person. Meanwhile, I don't think I need to cite further than the Epstein files to show the ultrawealthy engage in all manner of immoral activity, ranging from financial fraud, sex trafficking networks, pedophilia, hell, there's even disturbing allegations of engaging in cannibalism.\n\n**10) Migrants influence elections <-> Ultrawealthy control political agendas**  \nMigrants are accused of introducing or supporting foreign or threatening political ideology.

For those who are unaware, it has become more frequent in the US at conferences or events or whatever for someone to acknowledge the fact that we are on \"stolen land\". I think this is pointless.\n\nMy main gripe when it comes to this is, yeah no shit we are on stolen land. Every piece of land throughout human history has been stolen at some point, other than some like island tribes completely disconnected from civilization. \n\nIn New England, where I live, some of the native Americans who we acknowledge are the Abenaki, Pennacook, and Piscataque tribe. My question to the people who make these acknowledgements is- who do you think these tribes stole their land from? I mean, some people are gung-ho about Americans acknowledging stolen land, but do we really think that the Native Americans lived in complete peace and harmony for the \\~12,000 years they were there before we colonized? It's totally ignorant to pretend like these tribes didn't war with eachother and conquer eachothers' land.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point- how far back do we need to acknowledge land? Who does this land actually belong to? In most land acknowledgements we only acknowledge who was there before us, but fail to acknowledge whoever may have been third in line. Shouldn't we trace back to the first ever human beings which were displaced from where we are talking about and give them credit for being the only guys not to have stolen the land?\n\nI think as well that it is totally ignorant of the concept of conquest, which is inherent in almost every single human civilization throughout history. In the case of the US, we did not *steal* the land from the Native Americans, the British Empire invaded them and annexed territory. That's what empires do. They conquer and expand. If anything they should be thankful that countries are not as imperialistic as they were back in the 1600s+\n\nLastly, what do they want us to do about it? Give back the land? Should the US just throw our hands up and secede half of our country back to Mexico? Give the native Americans back their original territory to how it was 400 years ago?\n\nSorry if this is a bit all over the place, but these are just my thoughts.

He has been grooming the Russian military for decades. According to documents leaked in 2023, after securing the Ukrainian flank, Putin expected to easily do the same to the Baltic states while NATO would do little more than issue formal statements of complaint at the UN assembly. A new Soviet Union would then largely be restored and Russia would cement its presence as one of the major powers alongside the United States and China for the remainder of the 21st century. \n\nIn view of this, what happened in practice was a nightmare scenario. Even if Russia comes away from this war with a small portion of Ukraine that is by now entirely destroyed and almost completely de-populated, over the last four years it lost much, much more. \n\n* Instead of erasing the Ukrainian statehood, Putin has now cemented it though fire. Ukraine between 1991-2014 was politically divided between its Pro-European nationalist west and relatively more Pro-Russian and less nationalist east. There was a real chance that long-term Ukraine would fall back into Russia's sphere of influence. That will not be the case following this war. A Pro-Russian politician like Yanukovych will not come to power to Ukraine for a long, long time. Speaking Russian in Ukraine is now considered a grave sin. From my experience, even the Ukrainians on the far east who spoke Russian for generations have all switched over to Ukrainian. Whatever cultural bond existed between Russians and Ukrainians after the USSR's collapse is gone. Ukraine is now a nation with a unique history, a war-hardened military capable of stopping its gravest enemy, and a national identity undeniably distinct from Russia's. \n* Instead of fragmenting NATO, Putin expanded and hardened it. Finland and Sweden joined only because of his invasion further exposing Russia's border with the West. European countries which have been largely demilitarized and pacifist for decades have finally started making serious investment into their militaries and national security. There was a real chance Donald Trump might've ditched Europe for Russia. It is very difficult to see that happening now with America having strong economic interests in protecting Ukraine's rare minerals and buying Ukraine's drones. Worst of all, Russia will likely now face a strong, war-hardened, stringently Anti-Russian Ukrainian military right at its border for the remainder of the century. Ukraine coming back to restore its lost land will now be a constant threat.\n* Instead of solidifying Russia as a major power, Putin solidified Russia as China's junior partner. Russia's economy is now smaller than Italy's and is completely isolated on the world stage. Financially, it now relies almost entirely on China buying its oil. China has changed its purchasing terms multiple times already and every time Putin bends the knee. He knows that if China stops buying his oil, Russia is done for. He is now Xi's puppet in all but name. With a third of the federal budget going to fund the war, inflation and interest rates reached double-digits and living standards for any Russian outside of Moscow or St Petersburg completely collapsed. Lastly, Russia's only real pre-war asset - its military which Putin has been building for decades - was greatly weakened in Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands (if not a million) Russians died on the battlefield. With each passing year, Putin has extensively needed to rely on North Korean, Iranian, African, and Chinese fighters more and more. It will take decades to restore Russia's pre-war military strength and Russia will not seriously threaten anybody again for a long time.\n\nIt is entirely possible that Putin might go down in Russian history as the man who conquered Donbass. He will also go down as the tsar who forever lost Russia's superpower status.

The comments here are ruthlessly mocking him for being short. I believe they are using the excuse of \"I'm not mocking him for being short, I'm mocking him for being insecure about it!\". I've found no evidence that this ICE agent is insecure about his height, so I'm curious as to how they got to that conclusion.\n\nThis reminded me of the time that the staff of the white house had a photo shoot, and people ruthlessly mocked Karoline Leavitt's skin.

Insulting people based off of these features insults countless good people who share their traits, and it inherently implies that the trait being mocked is worthy of being mocked, regardless of circumstance.**\n\nI've premeditated a few objections, which will not change my mind\n\nObjection 1. \"I'm not making fun of these people for xyz, I'm making fun of them for being insecure about it! The type of person they are would be!\". I don't care if they would be insecure about in whatever hypothetical we conjure up. I mentioned this at the top. I will not make fun of a woman who I dislike or view as bad for having a small chest, regardless of whether or not I think that would \"really make a woman like her mad\". I won't make fun of a mans height or penis size, because I don't view an abundance or lack of in either area to be a negative.\n\nEven if the target were insecure, mocking the trait still relies on the assumption that the trait itself is worthy of ridicule. Otherwise, the insult wouldn’t work. I, again, do not care about \"if they specifically would be the type of person to be offended, but only because they're insecure!\". Regardless of their insecurity, I won't CMV on this stance.\n\nObjection 2. \"I don't care. They're bad people so I can do or say whatever I want.\" Of course you can. My mind won't be changed regarding this stance.\n\nObjection 3. \"Well, bad people do it! And if bad people do it, then I should be able to do it to\". I think we can see why this won't change my mind.\n\n**What WILL change my mind (that I know of).**\n\n1. If you can convince me that some people's bodies are inherently shameful and therefore deserve mockery. I think this is unlikely, but I'm here to see arguments.\n2. That some people need to be used as emotional collateral damage or else reform will never occur. If you can convince me that world war 3 will start unless we say Karoline Leavitt needs dermabrasion, I'm listening. As long as this doesn't interfere with premeditated objection one, I'll entertain it.\n3. That said collateral damage doesn't exist, and the only people who are affected (other than me not liking it) are the people the insult is directly hurled at. However if I read one reply here that says they care, this option goes out the window.\n4. That every trait on everyone's body gets attacked equally I.E (Vance and Trump get criticized for being 6ft+ the way the ICE agent who is 5'4 gets critiqued). I don't believe this is real, but if you can find me articles regarding how tall men act in a similar vein to the thread linked above, I'll consider it.\n\nI am not arguing that these people should be treated kindly, only that criticism should target actions, beliefs, or choices rather than immutable physical traits.\n\nFor all curious, I'm 5'10, 175lbs and biracial.

A man met a woman at a coffee shop (they're both regulars). They had a few conversations and then the man asked out the woman. The woman rejected him because she already had a boyfriend. The man was understanding and stopped asking her.\n\nThe man then told a coworker, and the coworker told him that what he did was creepy. The comment were overwhelmingly NTA, and people were even saying that they don't like people who think/act like the coworker.\n\nI think there needs to be a lot more pushback against people like the coworker.  The man did everything right : asked her out at an appropriate place (a coffee shop), got to know her (so they weren't strangers), and politely backed off when she said she already had a boyfriend. Yet he was still labelled a creep. Right now, a lot of men are afraid to ask out anyone at all, due to fear of being labelled a creep or weirdo. This is not reasonable.\n\nI think people need to make a very clear statement about this: If a man asks out a woman in a place intended for socializing, gets to know her, and immediately stops pursuing her if she rejects him once, then it's **not** creepy, **not** sexual harassment, and the man does **not** deserve any negative labels such as \"creep\" or \"weirdo\". It doesn't matter how ugly, unattractive or socially awkward he is. He is not a creep. I think most of the people saying \"NTA\" agree with that statement. \n\nBut I don't think it's enough to just say that. We need to further and call out the people labelling those men as creeps (such as the coworker in the other thread). If someone says things like \"I was a club/event and some weirdo asked me out, I just want to do the activity in peace, why can't men leave me alone\", I think we should tell them \"No, the weirdo here is you, not him. He asked you out and then dropped it as soon as you rejected him. He didn't do anything wrong. You're the weirdo for labelling him a weirdo when he did what he everything he was supposed to do correctly\". (of course, the caveat here is that the man must have actually done everything correctly. if he kept asking despite being rejected, then he actually is a creep and deserves to be called a creep).\n\nI think that it's necessary to call out people labelling completely normal, kind, good men who respect women as creeps. Otherwise the result is that men are afraid to approach women and choose not to (and that includes the cute guy that you are always hoping would ask you out some day). There is already a lot of men who just never ask out any woman because they're afraid of being labelled a creep or sexual harasser. And then single women who are looking for a boyfriend are wondering why nobody asks them out anymore.\n\n", "author": "Suspicious-Host9042", "score": 932, "num_comments": 1060, "created_utc": 1769878546.0, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/1qs7kfy/cmv_society_should_push_back_against_not_being/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1qs7kfy/cmv_society_should_push_back_against_not_being/"}, {"id": "1qjfm7e", "subreddit": "changemyview", "title": "CMV: ICE needs legal accountability.

At the very least, I am entirely focused on a singular thing here: accountability. And ICE has next to none.\n\n[According to Caitlin Dickerson of The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/minneapolis-shooting-ice-dhs-guardrails/685565/), the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman have all been completely gutted.  These offices served to audit ICE actions and hold agents responsible for anything that has clearly gone \"too far\". However, the Trump administration sees no value in such things. After Renee Good was murdered, the Vice President himself even said that ICE has [\"absolute immunity\"](https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-minneapolis-ice-shooting-defense-immunity-minnesota-11331877) when performing their duties. Think about the possibilities in this scenario.\n\nFor example, say an ICE agent is just having a shitty day, perhaps stressed from his job, or his dog just died, or his wife just left him. Or maybe he's been instructed by his superiors to be more aggressive on the street, and if he isn't more aggressive, he'll lose his job. He's out there on his beat, and someone on the street looks at him kinda funny. He punches the person in the face, knocks him to the ground, and then proceeds to beat the shit out of him, pounds his face in, breaks his fucking nose, whips out his pepper spray and sprays it mercilessly in the guy's eyes, sprays so much of it that the guy ends up becoming permanently blind. He yells at the guy to shut his fucking bitch mouth, that he'll murder him like his friend killed that lesbian c\\*nt last week. Multiple eyewitnesses at the scene saw it all happen, even recorded a video of the incident, and the evidence tells a crystal clear story: there was no threat to the ICE agent, none whatsoever, nothing that could even remotely justify this outburst, whereas there's conclusive evidence that could be shown in a court to show that the ICE agent committed assault, pure and simple.\n\nThen, instead of taking action on any of this, leadership turns a blind eye and instead cites some statistics about how many of their officers are being harassed and how this one vehicle of theirs got torched and that's so unacceptable and such. They just change the narrative, refocus the public on something else. And no institution takes any action on this ICE agent. Worse yet, the actions of this agent might even reflect a part of a greater, more sinister offensive to assert authority under a fascist power-grab.\n\nNone of what I have described here is outside the realm of reality. The powers-that-be are currently showing no interest in stopping any of this and may even be encouraging more of it. Who in their right mind could possibly be okay with someone getting away with this? Why would anyone be okay with this?\n\nEven if you support ICE's existence, even if you support the deportation of undocumented immigrants, I cannot possibly understand the need for the agents performing this work to have \"absolute immunity\" in doing so. Why? The existence of undocumented immigrants in our country is not so horrendously deleterious to us all that we have to allow agents to commit borderline war crimes to carry out their duties. They are perfectly capable of performing said duties without resorting to these extremes, as we clearly learned during the Obama administration when he [deported 5.3 million people](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/obama-record-deportations-deporter-chief-or-not), all while ICE agents still had oversight and WERE accountable for their actions.

I'm not sure I've had a chance to review all of them, but I hope to eventually. Those that I've seen already still haven't swayed me, but I appreciate most of the points made by everyone so far regardless of what side you take on the matter.\n\n---\n\nThis is an interesting topic that I've begun to see some of the other perspectives on lately, but ultimately my contention comes down to this: \n\nThere is nothing wrong with calling the USA \"America\" and its citizens \"Americans\".\n\nPlease note that my view isn't that all nations and people should teach this, only that it should be respected that this is the terminology of choice for the US and its citizens *and* should be the default terminology *in the English language specifically*.\n\nI see a lot of Latin Americans calling out this use of \"America\"/\"American\" as US-centric or as an example of US-defaultism. This largely seems to come from the fact that in most of Latin America, it is taught that the Western Hemisphere is one continent called America, whereas in the US, the teaching is that there are two continents in the Western Hemisphere, North America and South America.\n\nMy contention is quite simple and breaks down into three points.\n\nFirst, residents of the British colonies that became the USA started calling themselves \"Americans\" to distinguish themselves from other English subjects. This came from a practical and innocent place.\n\nSecond, the American Revolution (USA) came before the revolutions in rest of the Americas. Simon Bolivar for example, whose work had a tremendous impact on the revolutionary movements of much of Latin America, wasn't even born until after the American Revolution (USA) started. \n\nThus, at the time the US identity as \"America\" and \"Americans\" was developing, the rest of the Americas were still fundamentally subjugated extensions of European powers. The USA was the first and only (at the time) distinctly American nation recognized as independent of its colonial parent. Everyone else was a subject of Spain, Portugal, France or the Netherlands. By the time other American nations and identities started arising in the rest of the Americas, the self-identification as America/American was already well-established.\n\nA point could be made that indigenous communities were also independent and American, but they usually had their own names (Cherokee, Navajo, etc) and/or were considered under the crown of whatever colonial power had nominal control of an area. \"American\" wouldn't have been a self-identity for most indigenous people of the time.\n\nThird, North America and South America are distinct enough in geography and culture that insisting them to be a single continent feels tremendously generous to the definition of the word. There is a nigh impassible jungle in the south of Panama at incredibly narrow strip of land (the Darrien Gap). The South America mass is clearly South of it, and the North American mass is clearly North of it, they are Geographically separate places.\n\nAlso, South America's colonial history is almost exclusively dominated by the historical influence of Spain and Portugal, whereas North America *has* Spanish influence notably in Mexico and the Carribean (which should be considered regionally separate anyway), but its primary colonial influences are those of England and France.\n\nTo be clear, I have no issue with LatAm countries teaching that it is all one continent called \"America\". I simply think there is enough reason to consider it two continents that it shouldn't be considered US-defaultism to separate them into North America and South America and use \"America\" to refer to the country and not the larger Western Hemisphere landmass, particularly in the English language.", "author": "amortized-poultry", "score": 879, "num_comments": 1112, "created_utc": 1770737209.0, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/1r13qlr/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_with_calling_the_usa/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1r13qlr/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_with_calling_the_usa/"}, {"id": "1qjoeo6", "subreddit": "changemyview", "title": "CMV: Pickleball is just tennis for unathletic people", "selftext": "As a former high school tri-athlete (glory days where I peaked), I see more and more people trying to invite me to play this “sport”.

They know trump attempted to overthrow an election. The party as a whole is complicit in normalizing and covering for it. Trump committed sedition and enabling and empowering him requires minimizing that fact. You can't knowingly do this without rejecting the very premise of American Democracy. \n\n**The Fake Elector Scheme**\n\nThis is *very* straightforward. But people can be blinded by the politics. The simplest way to understand this is to ignore the politics and look at the physical **documents**. I’ll make this as simple as possible. \n\nImagine a fan is kicked out of the Super Bowl. He *truly believes* he should be allowed in.\n* **Legal:** He sues the stadium.\n* **Illegal:** He goes to Kinko’s, prints a **fake ticket** that looks exactly like a real one, and tries to hand it to the gate agent.\n\nOnce you hand over a fake document, you have committed fraud. **It does not matter if:**\n* **You truly believed you deserved a seat.** (Motive doesn't excuse forgery).\n* **You got caught before you made it inside.** (Attempted fraud is a crime).\n* **You think the refs are corrupt.** \n\nHere is the proof that Trump’s team printed the fake ticket and tried to use it.\n\n**1. Identity Theft (Impersonating the State)**\nIn America, campaigns don't certify elections; **States** do. The Trump team didn't just write a letter saying, \"We protest.\" They [created documents that mimicked the exact font, formatting, and language of official government certificates](https://sourcenm.com/2022/12/23/scope-of-new-mexicos-fake-elector-scheme-detailed-in-jan-6-committee-report/) — [and here they are for all of the other states](https://www.archives.gov/foia/2020-presidential-election-unofficial-certificates).\n\n* **The Fraud:** They signed papers claiming to be the *\"duly elected and qualified\"* officers of the State. [They even set out hide in statehouse overnight to ensure they’d be there behind security when counting started](https://www.yahoo.com/news/insane-plan-fake-trump-electors-182909918.html). \n\n**2. The Written Confession**\nWe don't have to guess if this was a misunderstanding. The architect of the plan, Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, [wrote down the strategy in private emails](https://www.lawforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Chesebro-Troupis.pdf). He admitted the goal was to create a \"fake controversy.\" He explicitly noted that they should send these fake documents **even if they lost their court cases**.\n\n**3. Trump Knew It Was a Fraud**\nThis wasn't a case of \"lawyers brainstorming\" while Trump sat in the dark.  On January 4th, in the Oval Office, Trump’s lawyer [John Eastman admitted to Trump’s face that this plan to reject votes violated the Electoral Count Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/html-submitted/ch3.html). Trump knew it was illegal and did it anyway.\n\n* **The Order:** [Trump personally called Ronna McDaniel (RNC Chairwoman)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/html-submitted/ch3.html) to direct the RNC to help assemble these fake electors.\n\n***\n\nIt is Department of Justice policy that a sitting President cannot be prosecuted. Trump’s legal team successfully delayed the trials long enough for him to win the election. Once he won, the Special Prosecutor had to drop the case because it became legally impossible to proceed. Congress interviewed him around the New Year. I’ll give you three guesses why they picked such an inconvenient time in the news cycle. He testified under oath that the prosecution became unpracticable once he became president again.  \n\nHe didn't beat the charges; he beat the clock. But the evidence of the fraud didn't vanish. We can still see it. \n\n**Summary**\nWe have the emails planning the forgery. We have the fake papers they signed. We have the testimony that Trump was told it was illegal. The fact that the man who ordered the counterfeit ticket is now running the stadium doesn't make the ticket real. It just means he got away with it.\n\nSome Republican voters have the benefit of ignorance. They can claim to be victims of right wing echo chambers. Before reading this, they could have even bury their heads and remained *willfully* ignorant. But professional lawmakers know what they're doing. These people are by and large knowingly traitors to the Republic. \n", "author": "fox-mcleod", "score": 616, "num_comments": 371, "created_utc": 1769873676.0, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/1qs5f3i/cmv_being_a_loyal_republican_politician_requires/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1qs5f3i/cmv_being_a_loyal_republican_politician_requires/"}, {"id": "1qj523x", "subreddit": "changemyview", "title": "CMV: Of all the things Trump has done, pardoning nakedly corrupt people is the worst in terms of displaying his true character.", "selftext": "Of all the things that trouble me about Trump, this stands out more than anything else.

Taken together they send a very strong signal: that Trump is himself corrupt, that he surrounds himself with people who are likewise corrupt, greedy, or unethical, and that he is willing to use his power to shield them from consequences when it suits him.\n\nYes, Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct and people still froth at the mouth about the Epstein files, but these things are murky and unsubstantiated.

In fact, the official story from the government is that the presence of the firearm on his person gave authorities justification to kill him, for he was a reasonable threat to the life and safety of \"law enforcement\" for merely possessing the weapon in that situation.\n\nAnd while you may argue that was a violation of his 2A rights (and it was), it still goes to show that if a government wants to kill you, it will find a way to kill you, no matter if you are lawfully carrying a firearm or not.\n\n**Point 2: Any attempt to actually use 2A for this stated purpose will immediately lead to you being labeled a terrorist, and most likely killed.**\n\nNow let's say Pretti actually interpreted this government as being tyrannical, if he actually DID attempt to engage with federal agents with his firearm, what would happen?\n\nHe would be killed, and if he survived, he would be labeled a terrorist, hunted down and imprisoned or killed.\n\nAnd what if he didn't initiate the engagement, but rather used his firearm to defend himself after being jumped by 6 armed masked federal agents, spraying him with mace and beating him senseless?\n\nHow would the State react? Would he be afforded a proper self defense claim? Of course not, he would also be labeled a terrorist in this situation, and quickly imprisoned or killed.\n\n**Point 3: Rampant gun ownership does little to actually prevent the rise of tyranny**\n\nIt is difficult to argue that a government that is unleashing masked men on the streets of American cities to terrorize local communities and rough up anyone that gets in their way - even American citizens utilizing their first amendment rights - with impunity is anything other than tyrannical, especially after they have already killed multiple citizens and lied about the circumstances of their deaths to shield these agents from accountability.\n\nThe US has more guns in the hands of citizens per capita than any other nation on Earth, yet it is doing little to abate the rise of authoritarianism. In fact, I believe it is actually doing the opposite as the majority of gun owners align with the burgeoning authoritarian government. As such, widespread gun ownership is more likely to entrench a tyrannical government than prevent one.\n\nSince so many gun owners are aligned with the aims of such a government, widespread gun ownership leads to the rise of more paramilitary groups to terrorize dissident citizens into submission.\n\nAnd even if they aren't willing to actively fight to entrench the power of an authoritarian regime, since so many align politically with such a government, they will not use their 2A rights to oppose them since they want that government to succeed, and their perceived enemies (in this case \"the left\") destroyed or marginalized.\n\n\\---\n\nIn conclusion, we've been sold a lie as to why we could do nothing to solve the gun crisis in America, even after elementary school children were slaughtered in schools.

I believe the current US government falls under the ideals of fascism as defined by Mussolini who started the movement, and Umberto Eco who lived through it and wrote \"Ur-Fascism\" or \"Eternal Fascism: Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt\" to warn future us!\n\nI have mapped \"proof\" to The 14 Points of Ur-Fascism but I'm not a political scientist, nor am I an American. I think the Trump administrations covers each point, but I'm open to be proven wrong, if you can demonstrate that the US actions are consistent with a liberal democracy or that I am misapplying the definitions of fascism.\n\n**1. Cult of Tradition** \"When all truth has already been revealed by tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.\"\n\nThe administration consistently appeals to a mythic past \"Make America Great Again\" and promotes a specific traditionalist view of family and religion. It uses it's powers to enforce values over modern secular ones. One example is the gradual undoing of federal abortion rights protections.\n\n**2. Rejection of Modernism**: Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.\n\nThere is a clear rejection of established climate science and medical consensus (vaccine skepticism), viewing any expert consensus as a tool of the \"deep state\" to weaken the nation. At the same time boasting about the capacity of AI, coal and oil industries, and the Gold Dome.\n\n**3. The cult of action for action's sake:** Dictates that action is of value in itself and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science\n\nSelf explanatory, but the impulsive nature of governance. Policy announcements made via social media without bureaucratic review, prioritizing dominance, and headlines over intellectual reflection.\n\n**4. Disagreement is treason:** Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith\n\nTrump and the administration's rhetoric labels political opponents not just as rivals but as \"enemies within.\" Threats to use the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute political adversaries align perfectly with this point. \n\n**5. \"Fear of difference\"**, which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.  \n  \nThis is the core of the administration's immigration policy. The rhetoric about immigrants \"poisoning the blood of the country\", or eating dogs and cats, is a direct appeal to the fear of the Other. Deploying ICE to harass the populace of Minneapolis. \n\n**6. \"Appeal to a frustrated middle class\"**, fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.\n\nTrump's movement relies on the economic anxiety of the everyday working class, blaming their financial stagnation not on market forces but on specific out-groups (immigrants, globalists). \n\n**7. \"Obsession with a plot\"** and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups. Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.  \n  \nConspiracy theories, from \"The Big Lie\" about election fraud, \"Russia hoax\", and claims about the \"Deep State\" sabotage. \n\n**8. Enemies are too strong and too weak:** Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as \"at the same time too strong and too weak\". On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.  \n  \nThe \"Left\" is portrayed as a weak, degenerate force destroying the country, and also a powerful cabal capable of rigging elections, not giving him a Nobel peace prize, and using stage protestors, to undermine his rule.\n\n**9. \"Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy\"** because \"**life is permanent warfare**\" – there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.\n\nCompromise is viewed as weakness. Allies are seen as future enemies. \n\n**10. \"Contempt for the weak\"**, which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate leader, who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.\n\nThis is visible in the mocking of disabled reporters, the cutting of social safety nets for the poor, and a foreign policy that disdains alliances in favor of sheer power dynamics\n\n**11. \"Everybody is educated to become a hero\"**, which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, \"\\[t\\]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.\"\n\nThe rhetoric often glorifies vigilante action and pardons those convicted of war crimes or violent political acts, signaling that \"heroic\" violence is state-sanctioned\n\n**12. \"Machismo\"**, which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold \"both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality\"\n\nThe political style is hyper-masculine, often deriding women critics in gendered terms, rolling back reproductive rights, trans rights.\n\n**13. \"Selective populism\"** The people are conceived monolithically, have a common will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he alone dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of \"no longer represent\\[ing\\] the voice of the people\".\n\nThe US President claims to speak for \"The People\" as a monolithic entity. Any protests or votes against him are dismissed as illegitimate or fake, implying that only his supporters count as \"The People.\" \n\n**14. \"Newspeak\"** : fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary to limit critical reasoning.\n\nAny time the US presidents opens his mouth, or writes something on truth social, brain cells die. But also any criticism is immediately labeled as \"Fake News\" without any critical discourse.\n\nMussolini defined fascism as: \"Everything in the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the State.\"   \n  \nHis book **The Doctrine of Fascism** says:   \nThe Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State – a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values – interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.\n\nFascism is a religious conception in which man is seen in his immanent relationship with a superior law and with an objective Will that transcends the particular individual and raises him to conscious membership of a spiritual society. Whoever has seen in the religious politics of the Fascist regime nothing but mere opportunism has not understood that Fascism besides being a system of government is also, and above all, a system of thought. \n\nWhen I look at the purges of the civil service, the dehumanization of opponents, and the demand for total loyalty, I see a government that checks every box of Eco's list and fulfills Mussolini's dream of a State that consumes all distinct values.\n\nTo change my view, please demonstrate how these specific behaviors are compatible with a functioning liberal democracy, or show me where I have misinterpreted the historical definitions of fascism.\n\n", "author": "ivo_sotirov", "score": 519, "num_comments": 635, "created_utc": 1770296975.0, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/1qwkug8/cmv_the_us_government_is_fascist_in_the_strict/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1qwkug8/cmv_the_us_government_is_fascist_in_the_strict/"}, {"id": "1qe7boh", "subreddit": "changemyview", "title": "CMV: The suggestion from non-Americans to practice our second amendment right now is ridiculous.", "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a lot of comments from non-Americans saying something to the effect of, “Don’t Americans have the right to bear arms?“\n\nMaybe I’m being thick, but I find it preposterous to suggest that we take our itty-bitty guns and revolt against the government with the strongest military in the world.

When we think about rape, I think there is a misleading assumption that it's always aggressive, where a perpetrator holds down or drugs a victim into submission. While this devastating thing happens, I think, most of it happens through coercion, guilting, pressure, manipulation, etc. It's a similar evil, but it doesn't capture society's attention, making it seem like a greyer area than it actually is.\n\nThe way consent/sexual assault is discussed in the media shifts blame away from women, and distances itself from the fact that women can sexually assault. I think this is the case because we almost never give light to male SA victims/women perpetrators. If it does happen, the man is likely to receive misplaced advice, trolling, or outright hate. while the woman often escapes social condemnation, accountability, and ultimately, legal action. I think the most egregious example I can point to is when teenage boys get sexually assaulted by their teachers, and without any context, people react by saying he was lucky, or that it wasn't even bad, that they would've been happy in his situation. Not acknowledging that she took advantage of him, and he might be traumatized or permanently changed.\n\nBy failing to aptly recognize coercion and pressure as rape, and diverting blame away from women perpetrators, often onto their victims; I assert that social media leads many women, on some level, to distance themselves from the fact that they, too, can cause just as much harm to men as men and that every pillar of consent must remain standing for BOTH parties. I suspect this to be a more subconscious conceptualization than a conscious realization. Because of this, I believe women often pressure or manipulate men into giving consent, without reflecting or recognizing that what they did was actually rape. Related to that, I don't think men often recognize that they were a victim who was sexually assaulted, left in limbo, where one might feel confused and ashamed. The man doesn't heal or process what happened because it isn't taken seriously, and the woman might feel it wasn't 'that bad' or even that it was normal sex with sufficient consent.\n\nThese are two sides of the same coin; the same conditioning led to problems for both. That's why I believe it is a societal issue, not an issue of biological sex or innate qualities.\n\nA few notes before you take my opinion into account. I am speaking from my own personal experience and stories I've heard from my friends. I can confidently say that within my male social sphere, getting pressured and coerced into sex is not an uncommon issue. I am also speaking from my experience using social media, reading the news, and being the receiving end of inaccurate ideas about consent. Importantly, while sexual assault is the topic I am focusing on, I think this sort of thinking extends to general abuse (the Amber Heard case), bullying, and other related topics. Finally, I am NOT arguing that women do it more than men; I believe that is untrue. I don't, however, believe the gap is nearly as big as we think it is.\n\nP.S.

Some of these include consent, communication, safe practices, and sexual education. Furthermore, they state that a predominant belief of the movement is to fight against not only slut-shaming, but more notably, prude-shaming.\n\nPrude shaming is a very real thing, especially on Reddit and social media, and directly challenges the movement of sex positivity while simultaneously claiming to be supporting it.

By “mystification,” I mean a tendency to treat institutions as black boxes whose internal logic is either unknowable or not worth understanding, even when well-developed explanatory frameworks exist.\n\nMarkets are a clear example. In public discourse, they are often framed either as a panacea that automatically corrects social and industrial problems, or as an inherently coercive force that traps ordinary people in systems of inequality. Both framings treat markets as monolithic forces rather than as mechanisms with specific conditions under which they work well or fail. This persists despite any basic economics course detailing the basic ways markets work well and the basics way they fail.\n\nThis pattern extends beyond markets. Discussions of science and AI frequently rely on crude heuristics (“science says,” “AI will replace everyone,” “experts are lying”) rather than attempts to understand how these institutions and processes actually function.

My claim is that *despite the existence of accessible, well-developed models*, public reasoning frequently defaults to mystification rather than partial or approximate understanding.

Its that people don't even attempt to try to understand institutions that our society has developed great and accessible tools to understand.\n\nI am limiting this claim to the U.S. because I live here, not because I believe it is unique.

There are varying degrees of positions with this core sentiment, but for this CMV, the only relevant point is that life begins at conception and, therefore, fetuses are granted moral consideration. \n\nMy contention with this position is that if this is granted, then miscarriages represent the largest loss of human life in the US.

The argument isn't that there will be a grand battle, determining the finale of the war effort, but rather that the cumulative effect of shortage of manpower on the Ukrainian side will result in the advancement of Russian forces far beyond their current positions. According to some estimates, approximately 25% of Ukrainian active military personnel is currently AWOL, which gives Russian forces a significant advantage.\n\nThe said collapse of the front line will not occur due to the exceptional efforts of the Russian high command, but rather due to the incompetence of Ukrainian generals, which allowed the Russians to gain material advantage. Mobilization buses are gaining more and more notoriety among Ukrainian citizens, who are now more likely than before to actively fight them. Various cases of violence against the servicemen of the TCR reinforce this point, showcasing the rise of widespread distrust towards the military machine in general.\n\nIn the second block I would like to elaborate on the reasons to believe that the main problem of Russia in this stage of the conflict is it's crumbling economy. Although Russian military spending is officially at 7,1% of the GDP, real economic exposure is far greater than that. Many of the Russian corporations are engaged in state and military contracts that either pay off partially, late or not at all. For instance, the second largest bank in the country — VTB — is actively investing enormous summs in the new Russian regions perfectly understanding that there will be no return on this investment. This is not a surprise given that the bank's second highest official — Denis Bortnikov — is the son of the director of the Federal Security Service of Russia — Alexander Bortnikov. This configuration is common to almost every big Russian corporation. They invest a large portion of their resources in the war effort under the facade of commercial activities, which eventually result in the lack of resources in other sectors of the economy, probably culminating in a full-scale economic crisis (which is already the case for some fields of Russian business).\n\nAs a Russian citizen and an entrepreneur, I personally see that almost all manufacturing companies that I know of are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy, taking out new loans to cover the interest on the previous ones.

In 2006, 82% of Afghans in Afghanistan stated overthrowing the Taliban was a good thing. In 2019, over fifteen years into the US bombing the country to smithereens, still 85% of all Afghans in Afghanistan had no sympathy for the Taliban. Even the most conservative numbers from the rural areas were at 83%. For all intents and purposes the Taliban is the functional political equivalent of a malignant tumor.)\n\nDepending on who you ask, military operations against them can be considered as imperialism. Additionally, military operations against extremist groups in Afghanistan don’t have the best human rights track record historically. Be it by boots on the ground or by overhead bombing, at least SOME civilians have always been killed, injured, displaced, etc.\n\nThen there’s sanctions. While sanctions are the more humanitarian alternative to all out warfare, this “humanitarian option” has also led to some of the greatest humanitarian crises of the last decade. There is little to no medicine in the hospitals, rampant poverty, staggering unemployment and hunger. And the people who suffer from sanctions the most isn’t even the Taliban. It’s the civilians.\n\nSo if sanctions and military intervention can both be considered to be unethical, the last option is recognition and diplomatic relations. The benefits of which 1) wouldn’t encourage the Taliban to change whatsoever and 2) would be withheld from women, or used to further harm. We could trade pharmaceuticals with them, and women would still be barred from accessing healthcare. We could invest in heavy industry, and they would use the profits from that to strengthen their extremist government. I would even go as far as to say that trading with a Taliban-governed Afghanistan directly invests in their unique repression of women.\n\nWhat then?

After seeing the events unfolding at other parts of the world (this includes the US) I realized just how fragile and idealistic my belief in democratic liberal institutions is. \n\nEurope is uniquely positioned as a former colonial powerhouse and the main theater of two world wars, and the EU is a one-of-a-kind institution where true democracy (please hold your laughs for now) with all of it's advantages and shortcomings are excercised. \n\nWhat the recent decades shown however, is that the EU is viewed as an unwelcome challenger against the other major global powers, namely Russia, China and the US, and things began to sharply escalate after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the 2024 US election it is increasinly likely that the US is also poised to completely abandon the alliances they built after WW2.\n\nI am not claiming that bilateral security agreements with our allies will necessarily stop altogether, my claim is rather that the EU is actively being undermined by foreign interests which seek to keep it weak and divided, and that the sovereignity of the member states can best realized only if the EU protects it's own interests and strengthens it's foreign policies as well as it's domestic ones. And the only way I see this happening, is if the EU federalises and creates a shared army.\n\nI believe that if this doesn't happen and the EU doesn't federalize soon, it'll either completely dissolve or it'll become a proxy ground and be torn apart by spheres of influence dictated by the other major players, none of which share a common idea of democracy or domestic policies. \n\nI could go into specifics about the economical goals too but that's besides the point for now.

I'll try to reply to as many as I can. After reading through the comments I'd like to add a few clarifications which are essential for my argument: The EU for me means the union in it's most recent form before the Ukraine war, i.e the version including much of the eastern european member states. These states are the most vulnerable of being treated as de facto vassal states by more powerful countries, as they were throughout most of history. Again we can disagree on how real the idea of state representation within the EU is, but we all should agree it's the best we've had in any of our shared history. This is now being actively challenged by weakening of democratic institutions both by forces within and without and in my eyes is reaching a breaking point. \n\nSecondly I am talking about a weak form of federalisation as a start where the EU maintains a common standing army - this is already an objectively better outcome than what we currently have with the USA effectively peacekeeping for us through a miriad of overseas bases. I believe that for a common european army a weak form of federalisation is necessary (i.e. we keep the principle of all nations representing themselves with veto power and full control over their own domestic matters but add the requirement of each providing a minimum amount of military reserves to train together). This would de facto be the first tear of a federal EU because we cannot only call it a market union anymore, even if it's mostly the same.

The period from the end of WW2 to the present day is a complete anomaly in the history of human civilization. The impetus for creating this system was the global ideological conflict between the USA and The Soviet Union in the aftermath of WW2. Rather than colonize the world, the Unites States did something rather unique and unprecedented. They opened their markets to the world and used their superior naval might to guarantee free trade and the free movement of energy across the globe. America benefitted greatly from this system, but so did the rest of the world.\n\nHowever, the tides have shifted. China has taken advantage of the American system and bootstrapped it to suit its own purposes. America has suddenly realized that if they continue on this path they will continue to grow weaker, while China grows stronger. America can no longer bully China economically or militarily. The landscape has shifted. The world is a fundamentally different place than it was 10 years ago.\n\nThe end result of this realization is that America is going to END the 80 year long system of global free trade because it is no longer in America's best interest to support it. Old alliances and bitter rivalries are going to be reevaluated. Virtually all of the manufacturing and industry in the global economy is within China's sphere of influence. China controls virtually all of the natural resources and industrial inputs. America needs to QUICKLY consolidate the Western Hemisphere and secure the raw materials it needs to reboot critical manufacturing and industry which it will locate in Mexico and Central America.\n\nGreenland contains vast quantities of exactly the raw materials that America needs, as well as controlling the artic circle shipping lanes. America wasn't interested before because it didn't need the resources and it didn't care about the strategic importance because there were no other countries on earth that could challenge its supremacy. The situation is now critical. \n\nNATO was created to combat the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union was the only significant threat to the United States. Now that the Soviet Union is no longer a threat and China IS a threat, NATO no longer makes sense for America. For 80 years the Europeans haven't had to worry about defense, because America took care of it on their behalf. As a result their ability to defend themselves against Russian aggression has atrophied. Strategically Europe is no longer a priority for the United States. The Europeans should have seen this coming and been prepared for it, but they clearly are not. \n\nUltimately Europe is so desperate for America to keep defending them that they will probably give up Greenland without much of a fight. Of course they have to posture like they are standing firm, but when push comes to shove they will fold.

He's very open about most of it. His image gets muddled because the media and politicians on the left want to portray him as a characters. \n\nThere are several values that Trump has that he's been consistent about. \n\n1) America is getting used in the world by friends and seen as weak by enemies. The irony here is that America is the most powerful country in the world but hasn't acted like it in a long time. \n\n2) America has \"bad deals\" everywhere and that's one of the reasons why our place in the world has declined. As a result, we waste too much money on stuff that doesn't work, we waste money on things that are bad for business, we giveaway money and don't use our leverage as the most powerful and largest consuming nation in the world.\n\n3) Trump is from a different generation and saw people from his generation die in Vietnam. He famously is quoted, long ago, as calling soldiers \"stupid\" in the context of fighting and dying in a war with lost causes.\n\n4) Trumps respect power and looks down on weakness. He respects wealth and looks down on handouts. If you criticize Trump, this won't make him be softer on your but will draw his ire. \n\nOn NATO, he thinks we're getting a \"bad deal.\" He wants them to pay more. He doesn't want to be Europe's sugar daddy. \n\nOn Russia, he knows Putin is a bad man but he respects his power. Putin also does not talk trash about Trump or America and always speaks to Trump with respect. Contrast that to European leaders, that castigate and talk down to Trump. Meanwhile, he sees Europe as weak and also leaches due to how much we pay for NATO. That's why he talks down to leaders like Macron. But he respects Meloni -- she always speaks respectfully of and to Trump and projects power. This is why he talked down to Trudeau.\n\nSo I think you're wrong about NATO and Putin/Russia. Continuing on this framework, of course he sees Denmark as weak (see his recent joke about how their defense consists of 2 dogsleds). \n\nThe geopolitical foe in this world that's on par with the US is China. To a lesser extent, he also respects Russia because of Putin's power, historical reasons with the Cold War and Russia's willingness for bold action beyond its borders (eg Crimea, Ukraine etc).\n\nFurthermore, Trump's view of the world has often been referenced to the Monroe Doctrine. That is, going back to President Monroe, he wants to make sure the Western Sphere is under our influence. That's why he has strongly supported Milei and took out Maduro. This is why he jokes about Canada being the 51st state. This is why he wants Mexico to be less influenced by China and wants to destroy the drug cartels (notably, Trump doesn't even drink after his brother died from alcoholism).\n\nA major possibility is that Trump is attracted to the resources in the ground. He's been open about drilling for oil in the US. He took out Maduro but left the rest of the Venezuelan govt in power and his first priority are to help American oil companies. \n\nAFAIK, Greenland doesn't have any known oil fields but they might just be undiscovered due to regulation. Greenland does have rare earths but they are hard (and expensive) to access. The argument that the ice caps are melting is silly to me -- he's not going to invest in Greenland so that we can wait 100 years for the snow to melt. We have access to rare earths in the US that are easier to get to. And the use of rare earths (eg in batteries and magnets) is changing rapidly -- people are actively redesigning these things so they're not reliant on the expensive/hard-to-get ones like cobalt.\n\nThere is the possibility that he looks at Greenland in the same way that we see Alaska now and why Seward bought it from the Russian Empire over 150 years ago. It's a comparatively small amount now that extend our power geographically. It locks down more of the Western Hemisphere, allows us better positioning into Europe and the Arctic and gives us better positioning against Russia and China. (In regards to us already having bases there, he does not like relying on other countries. He does not like these kinds of partnerships. He sees Europe as weak and slow.)\n\nSecondarily, we ended up finding gold and oil in Alaska and that's a possibility down the road. He sees land and the resources in the land as valuable.

This is critical for the \"Golden Dome\" missile shield intended to intercept ICBMs over the North Pole. Any ICBM launched from Russia to North America is going to fly over Greenland. Right now, there are early warning systems in place at Pittufik but owning the whole island would increase projection and range. Pituffik also coordinates with satellites as most fly over the Arctic regularly, so in any potential conflict it’s vital. \n* Blocking Chinese Influence: China is attempting to fund airports and mines in Greenland. U.S. sovereignty would legally bar adversarial state-owned enterprises from establishing a foothold in the North American backyard.\n* Northern Sea Route: As Arctic ice melts, new shipping lanes are opening. Controlling Greenland gives the U.S. a dominant position to monitor and regulate traffic moving between the Atlantic and Pacific.\n* Greenland has large deposits of rare earths, lithium, and cobalt, essential for fighter jets, satellites, and EV batteries. Direct control would allow the U.S. to fast-track mining projects that are currently stalled by local or Danish regulations.\n* Greenland contains massive uranium deposits which the US currently sources from Russia.\n* Submarines: Greenland is the \"G\" in the GIUK Gap (Greenland-Iceland-UK). Ownership would allow the U.S. Navy to build permanent, high-tech acoustic listening stations and sub-hunter piers directly on the coast to track Russian Northern Fleet submarines entering the Atlantic. It’s actually pretty hard to detect Russian subs and currently we do not have a base for our nuclear submarines at Pittufik, only in the UK. We could theoretically build one in Greenland.\n* We could also deploy assets instantly in response to Russian aggression without diplomatic delays.\n\nAnd as for your point about Europe going 'gung-ho' in response to Trump: just ask the average European/Brit if they would be willing to [fight for their country](https://www.gallup-international.com/fileadmin/user_upload/surveys_and_news/2024/Fewer_people_are_willing_to_fight_for_their_country_compared_to_ten_years_ago/Fighting_for_the_country.pdf). Most are not. That might seem minor, but it reveals the relationship that the average European has with their country. It is primarily a welfare state and a vehicle for their pet political ideology, not an actual civilization or fraternity worth fighting for. The average American genuinely believes they are the greatest nation on earth (sure, might be delusional) and there is an actual goal and reason for our nation's continued existence and hegemony. This creates support for war, equally if not more than a common enemy does. I highly doubt the average European feels similarly at all.   \n  \nNATO is not going to crumble over this. Europe needs America too much. They are not going to give up their welfare states and reorganize their societies to majorly remilitarize. They haven’t done it yet after years of war in Ukraine so the US probably feels it has the leverage and responsibility to pick up the slack from Europe. Sure, European military aid has increased to Ukraine. Germany created a 100bn euro defense fund in 2022. But its still buying F-35s and Chinooks from the US, and the fund will run out in 2027. Will they renew it then? With the slow pace of European bureaucracy, we likely won't even see the effects of the fund till 2028.  \nAlso, we don’t want a repeat of Nord Stream where Germany made the idiotic decision of buying gas from its geopolitical rival.

The Biden administration was heavily focused on economically populist policy, like tons of anti trust and pro consumer regulations and direct aid to average people. Kamala Harris did the same, focusing her campaign on cost of living, like with tax payer funded childcare, building millions of homes across the country, etc. \n\nYeah, there was focus on Trump being such a uniquely bad candidate too, because it was true. He was charged and facing trial for a dozen felonies for trying to overturn an election. He was ranting on stage about immigrants stealing and eating people's pets. It was important that especially left leaning voters take it seriously. \n\nA big issue though is that the Democratic party has basically an entire movement of people who are more focused on targeting Democrats and attacking policy that Democrats implement to try and snag some Dem +40 seat somewhere for a socialist than actually going after the right. \n\nProgressive and DSA candidates didn't win a single seat from Republicans. They rarely do. They basically only win in already solidly progressive areas. \n\nThis strategy has been a big contributor to Republicans taking near total control of the federal government. \n\nBut yeah, it just needs to be reiterated, these further left and socialist candidates are incredibly unpopular nationally. They consistently lose anywhere that isn't already solidly blue, and even struggle in really blue areas. They're not supported by the base they claim to represent, like blue collar workers, average middle class and poor folks, union workers, etc. \n\nTheir base is almost entirely affluent, white college kids in really blue cities, the least consistent voting bloc there is. One of Bernie Sanders' biggest issues was his inability to form a coalition and expand his base of support beyond this group.\n\nNot only are these socialist candidates disliked by basically the rest of the country, they actually end up harming the party nationally. The Democratic party gets painted as like them, \"crazy socialists\" who have no idea what they're actually doing, constantly talking about vague revolutions and tearing down this vague system or that with no concept of what that means. \n\nThen, they work to demotivate Democratic voters. Basically every policy that Democrats have passed has been attacked by progressives. It's to the point that actually having policy accomplishments is a negative. When Democrats implement a policy that targets corporations to the benefit of average people, instead of that being viewed as an accomplishment... It's thrown back at them as a bad thing, because it didn't meet whatever arbitrary criteria of \"left enough\" by progressives. It still happens now, with progressives consistently shit talking good, important policies, even as they're actively being dismantled by the right and we're trying to save them because people will be harmed without them. \n\nThis is the biggest issue Democrats are facing. They've been dealing with a decade long smear campaign from the left, and until we get past that, nothing else matters. It's an anchor weighing Democrats down and benefitting nobody but Republicans.

They care about good schools for their children, low taxes from their paychecks, affordable/high quality healthcare, and generally being left alone by the government. \n\nThese are all issues that Progressives pretty much fail on. The plans trotted out are the same plans from a century ago that have been proven to have low quality results at best.

And i think Trump is the perfect example of that, if not all of politics in the last 40+ years.  \nIt's all performative, and people vote on vibes a lot more than they vote on real policy.  \nNot saying nobody votes on policy, but in my opinion, at least 50% of votes are made in complete ignorance, if not more, based entirely on the vibes they get from hearing an ad or a campaign slogan and whether or not that resonates with what they want to hear.\n\nBecause of this, its not really about more left or more moderate that will bring voters in.  \nIt's messaging. What candidates need to be doing right now is appealing to populism. Especially economic populism.  \nPopulism isn't always the answer. It all depends on the state of the economy.  \nAnd every average American right now, on both sides of the aisle, agree on one thing: Economy sucks for your average worker.  \nBecause of this, the candidate who is willing to stand on stage and actually ADMIT this and promise changes to fix it, is the candidate that is going to inspire people to go to the polls.\n\nBecause of this, i think a progressive is MORE likely to garner votes right now, because they are the only ones who seem willing to actually push an economic populist message, while moderates actively try to avoid the topic altogether when they can.\n\nSociety moves in a cycle, typically, because of how political energy is generated.  \nPolitical energy (people paying attention to politics and voting) is higher when things are bad. Because people have more things affecting their day to day lives and therefore they feel the need to participate. And when things are going good, political energy decreases, because people check out once they feel like they don't need to pay attention any more. When political energy is low, corruption creeps in, because the People are not participating enough to prevent it. The corruption gets worse, things start to get bad, and then political energy increases again.\n\nSo the cycle ends up something like this:  \nGood -> Okay -> Bad -> Radical -> Repeat Radical until Good ->\n\nWe are in the Radical phase right now. During the radical phase, voters are desperate for something to change, because they can tell now that its getting worse and if something doesn't change, it will keep getting worse. That is why you are starting to see the extremes of both sides becoming more common right now. And it's why someone as radical as Trump can make it into office. Because he was (falsely) promising a fix, while the alternative was promising status quo.\n\nMy argument to you is: You cannot just assume that a Moderate position is always the best, in a vacuum. Because politics does not exist in a vacuum. Moderate positions work best when people feel like things are already good and they want to keep it that way. People absolutely DO NOT feel like things have been good for the last 10 years. And because of this, people will latch onto populism during this phase.  \nProgressives are the ones pushing populism right now, and that is why they are having success when they didn't before. Bernie has been a politician for decades. He became popular because things got bad and suddenly his message started to feel a little more acceptable by people who were desperate for anything other than continuing down the road of corruption. And Trump is the same, on the other side. People are desperate, and that is my argument to you why i think moderate is not the answer right now. A moderate status-quo position simply will not generate the energy at the polls because that is not what people are hungry for.\n\nOf course, my entire argument is based on economic policy. And i believe that economic policy is THE ONLY policy that really matters right now, in the election. So if a progressive stands on stage and confidently sends an economic populist message, i think they are MUCH more likely to appeal to voters than any moderate right now. The progressives just need to tone down so much rhetoric on social issues and focus on economics and i think it would be a landslide. Moderate democrats refuse to even admit that the economy is an issue, or downplay it heavily and that turns voters off, with where are are as a nation right now.\n\nOur last Radical phase was FDR, during the great depression. FDR was considered quite radical, and yet he is considered by many the best president we have ever had. And while we are not in a great depression today, people are feeling the \"bad\". And that increases radical acceptance. Trump was the first Radical choice the people made this time around. And they will continue leaning into Radical until one of them finally changes things for the better.

Trump and the Republicans have obviously seized on this, pushing forward policy that is unpopular among true moderates but highly motivating to their base. \n\nThe Democrats however, have not. Harris famously took a right turn this last cycle, she dropped Medicare for all, the DNC refused to allow the uncommitted movement to speak but allowed an Israeli to, she promised to be tough on the border, and so on.

In races that were considered to be lean democratic toss ups, meaning the odds were slightly in the Democrats favor, moderate democrats mostly lost their races. However, in races where they were Republican toss ups, we saw progressive canidates winning their races. \n\nThere's a few reasons for this. Firstly, negative partisanship, meaning you'll vote simply to make sure the other guy doesnt get in is primarily seen within Republican partisans and within mainstream democratic partisans. However  the left flank of the Democratic party is unique in that they are not affected nearly to the same degree by negative partisianship. They have absolutely no problem abstaining from voting if they dont think the party is making enough concessions which is one of the main reasons why Harris and other moderate democrats lost this last election.\nSecondly, Republican voters are not nearly as tied to MAGA as people make them out to be. A lot of MAGA voters are just populists, and will vote for a populist leftist as often as they'll vote for a populist on the right.\nFinally, Harris and moderate democrats lost support among key demographics, namely Hispanic women. While overall turnout number were similar for the Hispanic community between 2020 and 2024, we saw more Hispanic men rather than women turning out to vote. This is likely because Harris didnt put forward and policy to help these communities instead opting for a tough approach.\n\nI think if moderation would work, then Harris would have won 2024.

An alliance is not \"friendship,\" it's not \"affinity\" or \"sympathy\" of one country for another. An alliance is an association of countries formed for mutual benefit or to achieve common goals. An alliance has a clear purpose; it can't exist in the abstract, just because it's nice to have one. An alliance requires a consensus among its participants on what that purpose is and how to achieve it. Now, can you tell me what is the clear purpose of US alliance with Western European countries? Is there a consensus on that purpose and how to achieve it? The \"alliance\" between US and Western European countries is effectively defunct and only exists on paper. Trump didn't damage it, he's just the first to acknowledge the dysfunction. \n\nI keep stressing the term \"Western European countries\" because US alliances with Asian countries still exist and are still strong. South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, they are still on-board with US when it comes to military cooperation and defensive agreements. None of those defensive relationships are negatively affected by the current Trump administration. If anything, they are getting stronger. A large part of it is that there is a clear understanding and consensus on the purpose and procedures of those relationships. All those countries understand and agree that if a hot war with China breaks out, they are on the front lines of it, with US providing support and assistance. \n\nSame can be said about the Middle East. Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, etc. are all on board with US vision for the Middle East, and that US will no longer do the heavy lifting in the security of the region and will only assist in a supportive role. Hence, Israeli agents have to infiltrate Iran's nuclear sites, Israel's air force has to destroy Iran's air defenses, Israeli pilots have to take the major risk in clearing the path, and only then the US comes in and drops bombs on Iran's nuclear sites. \n\nEven in Europe, Eastern European countries, such as Poland, Romania and even Czechia (I know they're in Central Europe) are on board with US and effectively still have an alliance. The only countries where the alliance with US is broken are the Western European countries (plus Canada, but Canada is a separate issue entirely) that don't agree with US in the first place. And again, Trump didn't cause that disagreement, it existed since the mid-2000s, he's just the first to say enough is enough and take action over it. \n\n>something has greatly changed in the world's perception of America\n\nOverall, your post is very European-centric.

It’s actually incredibly easy, the calculation is economic benefits, both in military and civilian areas, in exchange for security and close political ties. The economic integration, and thereby domination, of the US in Europe is astounding. And I think just like Trump, you take a large chunk of that for granted.\n\nA very visible area is defense. For decades now, the US guaranteed security in exchange for American military bases needed to project power into the Middle East and Africa. The African command is in Stuttgart, Germany, the largest base outside of the US and main hub is Rammstein in Germany. Any evacuations from fighting in the Middle East or Africa wouldn’t make it back to the US in time - they instead fly to, again, Germany. All that in exchange for European military spending majorly flowing into US military industrial companies, funding US jobs and simultaneously subsidizing your domestic military spending with economies of scale. Why do you think Europe bought F35s? Because of NATO and the nuclear sharing that requires planes to be able to fly US nukes. For interoperability in NATO. This in turn makes F35s for the US Air Force 1/3 the price they would be if you only built them for yourself. It makes them cheaper for you, creates American jobs, American GDP and political influence through the tight integration. Lockheed Martin in turn receives money from US military spending, Norwegian military spending, German military spending, Dutch military spending, etc., etc. to ensure the next fighter jet will be cutting edge technology again, because the brain drain from Europe to the US fueled by astronomical salaries Lockheed Martin pays (financed by the aforementioned system). \n\nThis system is very visible in defense, but it applies to basically the entire economy. US tech, same story. \n\nWhy do you think China is such a competitor? Because they precisely ban this system from their economy, ensuring Chinese money pays for Chinese technology, Chinese jobs, Chinese companies. While European money flows to the US in massive amounts. For some reason, you, Trump and many Americans seem to think the relationship of US and EU is simple laws of physics, laws of nature. As a German, a lot of this reminds me of Wilhelm II.: Otto von Bismarck had created an intricate web of power and alliances to keep the peace in Europe, Wilhelm II wanted to do more free reigning power politics, fired Bismarck and threw out the web of alliances keeping the peace. The result you can read in history books, called WW1 and WW2.\n\nYou probably are lucky that Trump squirms at the first sign of pain in the market so he won’t push Europe enough to entirely kill this system (also because politicians in Europe fear such a transition and try everything to salvage it for stability instead of change; change that would be highly beneficial long term but painful in the short term). But he’s doing a damn good job at doing everything up to an inch to that line. And it’s apparent in defense already, because that’s a very visible area. Spain has canceled its F35 order entirely, Canada will likely keep the 16 they already paid for but cancel the rest, instead buying Gripen which will bring some 15k jobs to Canada instead of funding Lockheed Martin R&D and jobs in Texas. Portugal canceled, the list goes on and on.\n\nCall it American Exceptionalism or just plain ignorance and arrogance, what Trump is doing isn’t realism, it’s pure and utter destruction of probably the most dominant position a power has held in centuries.

They should fund third world countries, provide defense for their allies, and send their troops and military assets into small backwater nations to act as a sort of global police force, while never actually getting much at all in return. \n\nNo one was seriously going to annex Canada and you’d be a fool to think so. Canada is particularly reliant on the U.S and receives ton of benefits for being a close ally, far more than the U.S gets out of this partnership. And that’s fine. The U.S doesn’t expect to get the same kind of “return on their investment” but considering the nature of the partnership, it would make sense that Canada would do what they can to help out the U.S. Like idk, maybe not making deals with their greatest adversary and the west’s greatest adversary as a whole. \n\nAs for Europe, they do not really contribute all that much as it pertains to NATO. There’s not really a country in Europe that has a competent military and decades of ignoring their military obligations and relying on the U.S for defense has worsened the problem. Now some countries have very competent units within their militaries, but none are prepared to serious aid the U.S in a hot war. Many of the counties are dependent on Russia for energy and are actively destroying their nuclear energy facilities so they can buy more energy from Russia. The same Russia that they looked you dead in the face a few years ago and confidently proclaimed were planning to invade Western Europe. And also the very same Russia that’s been bogged down in a nasty ground war for almost 4 years against a much smaller and weaker country in which they border. \n\nEven if they eventually do take control of Ukraine (which they very well might), it doesn’t seem that they’d be equipped to push further into Europe, especially when it would be met directly by U.S. and NATO forces. I’ll preface this by saying that Canada and the UK did run operations with U.S forces regularly in Afghanistan and Iraq. They had the U.S back and they had theirs and they both knew it, they still relied heavily on U.S. air and ground assets to achieve their objectives, but they made legitimate contributions. France, Germany, Italy and others, did not. There were jokes when we were deployed out there that partner forces from those countries (or really any country that wasn’t Canada or the UK) never left the wire. Much of Europe’s contributions to that conflict was symbolic in nature. Now I’m not saying that these countries never ran operations out there and I have a tremendous amount of respect for those who fought and lost their lives, but the simple fact of the matter is that they did not contribute regularly. And to sit there and bring up those who died out there as “evidence” of Europe’s massive contribution to the GWOT is disingenuous and shameless appeal to emotion in an effort to win an argument. I respect the smaller nations that don’t have much in the way of a military that aided the U.S in the GWOT but if we’re filling up a bucket, and all you have is 3 drops and you give me 1 drop but I have 32 oz and I give 6 oz, who gave a larger contribution? I respect that you gave me proportionally more water, but still it’s just one drop unfortunately, even if it’s all you could give. \n\nAs for Greenland I’ll address the elephant in the room here, there are 50k people who live in Greenland. The US already has a fairly extensive military presence there and Denmark is a tiny country thousands of miles away, with little to no ability to project power. If you think the U.S is going to take military action to seize Greenland, you’re a fool. Frankly, they could drop the NYPD into Greenland with a little air support and the US flag would be hanging in Nuuk by lunch. But in all seriousness, I don’t see any legitimate reason to oppose the U.S. purchasing Greenland with the expressed intent of setting up a missile interceptor system to protect the U.S and Canada. The U.S. already built some in Europe, you know to protect Europe, and they’ve situated nuclear weapons in multiple locations in Europe as well. Frankly, it’s a fantastic deal for Denmark as the U.S. will likely pay a ridiculous amount to buy it from them, money that a small nation like Denmark could certainly use considering to my knowledge they don’t really have a ton of involvement in Greenland anyway. \n\nAs for Mexico, they’ve gotten so brazen under Sheinbaum. The country is functionally run by cartels and not only does it not aid the U.S anywhere near as much as Canada does, it actively goes against the U.S interest’s regularly and works with its adversaries. If you don’t want the U.S to take military action in your country against the cartels, then put together some steps to deal with them yourself or at least work with the U.S a bit to go after them. The simple truth that people don’t really want to acknowledge is that most countries can’t really do anything if the U.S chooses to take military action in their country. And often countries choose to do nothing when the U.S. actually does (Venezuela, Iran). They’ll threaten and make ridiculous claims about resisting the U.S but it’s all show, they’ll never actually do anything. Because they know if they take military action against the U.S, even defensively, it would kick off a hot war that they would almost certainly lose. When you have that kind of leverage it really doesn’t matter what Mexico wants, as long as Mexico doesn’t act against the U.S interest’s.

Think of the peaceful protests of the Civl Rights movement.  I and that vast majority of Americans my age and younger will forever have seared into their minds images of placid black Americans sitting inches from snapping German shepherds or being blasted by high-pressure hoses.  This kind of consistent peaceful protests *in the face of government violence and threats* is what helps complacent, ignorant, and even belligerent opposition change their tune.  Suddenly there is a moral high ground that is higher than their previously perceived moral high ground.  \n\nThey can press EJECT because they know the parachute is there.  They can say “well I want orderly and strict immigration law, but this or that is just too much!  I didn’t vote for this! It’s not who I am!”\n\nAnd that last bit right there is the solution.  They have to know that they won’t be strafed by fighter planes gunning for their parachutes.  You have to let people reframe their political and ideological frameworks one step at a time, and constant recrimination from their perceived opponents only serves to battle harden them, turning them from potential conscientious “ejecters” into social kamikaze.\n\nBut again, it’s not about the off ramp.  It’s about pressing forward until enough people see the higher moral than their current (immoral) morals.

He's shown us over and over again what a terrible human being he is, and we have had 3-5 NATIONAL ELECTIONS where people have had the chance to absolutely anonymously disavow him. \n\nIf you have regrets now but think it would be uncomfortable to admit the error of your ways, **fuck your feelings, snowflake.** The Trump train is cruising now, and if you want to jump off there's going to be one hell of a road rash. Your options are this: break with the fascists, or actively choose to stand with them and be a fascist.", "author": "ProjectGO", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1769473864.0}, {"id": "o1uhctp", "post_id": "1qnjod0", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": ">As for what these off-ramps look like, maybe an intermediary community to bridge the gap between ideologies, a change in messaging from the opposition? Its hard to say what would be effective here, as I'm not an expert.\n\nI dont fully disagree with the spirit of your premise, but I think it's looking in the wrong direction and not deep enough.\n\nReality is that every major fascist or apartheid or authoritarian system that has been successfully dismantled has involved punishing some of the more consequential collaborators and shaming the rest.\n\nYou will never bridge the gap the way you describe, because validating their fascism is never going to cure it.\n\nLets think back to a recent example: George W Bush and the Iraq War\n\nIt's a rather fascinating phenomenon but literally somewhere between 2007 and 2020 there was a Thanos snap and all the aggressive cult worshipping neocon Bush supporters on planet Earth largely disappeared before our eyes.\n\nI suspect, and this is just my hunch, if Trump's next 3 years are like his first, we will see another Thanos snap occur and you just won't be able to find more than a handful of proud MAGA anywhere.\n\nEveryone left will have always been against Trumpism and never really supported MAGA.\n\nNow what will be odd is that somehow there will still be roughly the same number of self identified Republicans/Conservatives as before the Thanos snap.\n\nAnd those conservatives will be telling us about how Trump was always a POS and Trump was always a fraud and cringe, and they knew the whole time. Right before they start slobbing over this new guy of theirs's Nick Fuentes or presidential nominee Tucker Carlson.....\n\nReactionary conservatism, which is the kindling from which fascism emerges, never goes away.\n\nBut it can be kept repressed and systematically locked out.\n\nBut to do that requires what didn't happen after Bush which is holding people accountable AND alleviating people's underlying immiseration and disillusionment with the political status quo.\n\nThe one major example we have of this in our history is the New Deal.\n\nI mean if you think about it from an economics standpoint, ICE is a jobs program for aggrieved, mostly white, overwhelmingly male people that feel their power and perceived social cache has been deteriorated. A lot of people that joined the Nazis were simply cause it was a paycheck and gave them a sense of empowerment.\n\nYou will have to abolish ICE but if you don't also have a stronger, better jobs program to replace it, that makes people hopeful for the future and feel a sense of their material conditions improving around them like the New Deal gave people, dialogue is not going to do much in the long term but fill the space between fascist movements gaining even more power next time.\n\n  \nSo TLDR: what needs to happen is in fact some level of De-Baathification of the entire leadership of the Trump movement in government, active collaborators, and allies in the private sector. To go with shaming the movement into embarassment for most of it's followers. Combined with policies like the New Deal that address people's underlying immiseration, sense of hopelessness, and feelings of disempowerment and social decline.

And having access to capital means you can grow your business in ways that affords you attention by local and State level government entities.\n\nIf you make $50K a year and want to talk to the Mayor or the City Council about the road near your home and changes you'd like to see, you get to do it at public hearings scheduled every week or whatever, and that's about it. Maybe something will happen if enough of your neighbors pitch in during the hearing. But that's about it.\n\nBut if you own a business that employs 50, 200, 1000+ people, you can quite likely have lunch with the mayor, city manager, important counselor or two, or even your state reps to see \"what can be done\" about improving roads and access to your business site.

This is someone who people pay specific attention to and make sure their requests are fulfilled before everyone else, whether the markets are open or closed, by the way. If someone wants to buy $10 million of something, Sunday morning at 4am is fine.\n\nOn a smaller scale, if you're investing $10,000 into a single stock, your broker is very much willing to disappoint you and a bunch of other \"small fish\" by buying a bunch of small lots at progressively higher prices (benefiting the seller), and meanwhile appeasing the guy that wants to buy $200,000 of that stock at a set price. This means your dollar is not equal to the dollar of others that the brokers want to please.\n\nJust imagine a billionaire who owns a business and employs 300,000 people in several states. Tens of thousands of those people all living in maybe a dozen communities.... they are people who spend 1/3 of their life devoted to a non-democratic endeavor (work) and because there are soo many people living this town and that town, the business has much greater influence over politics than other people and smaller businesses. I mean, the employees feel pressure to vote in specific ways that they know benefit them which benefits the mega corporation they work for which benefits the billionaire. Local services, property taxes, various business taxes... all hinge on keeping this very large bloc appeased.\n\nIt's all connected, money and politics, of course.\n\nAnd for this reason, it can be said that the more money you have, the more influence you have beyond just a simple analog.

Yes, it is absolutely true billionaires and the big corporations have too much power in American politics; and are responsible for areas like depressed wages, lack of paid time leave, data privacy, food safety,  insurance  bills, and now, utility bills with how these big tech companies are steamrolling through AI data center projects carelessly. \n\n\nBut, consider the other  side of the story. It's also very much true that there are actually too many guardrails and opposition from bottom up grassroots groups like construction unions, environmental groups and your average middle class-upper middle class homeowner that block building of many homes & infrastructure in a way that's fast and cheap for both private developers & the government.  Much of the financial insecurity and loneliness epidemic we're facing now comes from a scarcity of homes and lack of walkable neighborhoods with 3rd spaces. Many Americans consider housing to be their greatest financial expense at the moment. \n\n\nMarc Dunkleman went into great deal about this dilemma in his book \"Why Nothing Works?\" Right now, there are two thought movements going on post 2024 election: Fight Oligarchy vs. Abundance. \n\n\nI would say that neither Bernie Sanders/AOC nor Ezra Klein/Derek Thompson are telling the whole story of what's going on. Reality is a lot messier than blaming everything on billionaires or on a bunch of NIMBYs and stubborn unions.  \n\n\nIMO, the book \"Why Nothing Works?\" tells a more balanced picture of what's going on, and is most likely closer to the full picture. \n\n\nIt's certainly true there is potential for top down graft involving corporate lobbyists, but just as true that we give too much bottom up power to people at the local and state level. It's gonna require a balancing act by giving people a voice but also not giving them a veto power at the same time, especially in areas like housing, innovation, and infrastructure, all of which improve people's lives and overrall wealth. Note that veto ≠ voice.\n\n\nAs for real life examples, East Asia(S.Korea &Japan) is one area where they go full Abundance, but leave out most of Fight Oligarchy. Yes, things are efficient; and housing is built quickly and rent is relatively cheap. But, suicide rates have been increasing there due to poor work life balance and labor laws that are very weakly enforced. Not to mention, corruption is actually, I'd argue, a lot worse there with politicians literally being nepo babies & habitual slush fundies, especially the ruling LDP of Japan. \n\n\nOn the other hand, we have the well respected social democratic EU countries of Scandanavia and Central Europe. However, they simply receive too much praise. Yes, they have strong social safety nets and strong labor laws. However, they also have all these preservation laws and labor legacy laws that make it very hard to innovate and build housing, especially when they are experiencing lots of population growth from migrants in the Middle East. In short, they have trapped their economy in amber and have become open air museums. ", "author": "optimisticnihilist__", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1770755702.0}, {"id": "o4o5w2r", "post_id": "1r19x80", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": "There are only 900 billionaires living in the US.

He served as Chief strategist during Trump's first campaign, and 7 months as the same in this cabinet.\n\n\nIn 2020 he co-founded GTV Media Group and has continued to sponsor fake news outlets.\\\nBannon is also the creator of the strategy employed by the Trump administration today, 'Flooding the Zone'. It takes advantage of the 24 hour news cycle and humans limited ability to focus and concentrate.\\\nKeep Trump in the spotlight saying insane things, threatening allies whatever is necessary.

I've been following this case since around 2021 and I (along with many others) personally believe that a large part of what Epstein was doing was definitely known about and facilitated by the CIA. While the CIA is \\*technically\\* \"under the authority of the president\", it is considered independent in that its not part of a cabinet department like the DOJ, for instance. It's staffed by federal employees but there are also plenty of \"independent contractors\" so to speak which means they are not official government employees. The show Snowfall shows this \\*really\\* well with the character of Teddy. Congress had no damn clue what that man or his handler were up to.\n\nI don't say any of this to absolve any high ranking government officials of their part in any of this, but to illustrate that while you have a good point...that the government or a portion of it was actively involved in this in some way, I don't believe it was some well known p\\*do sex ring that the state department simply covered up and protected. America is such a mess when it comes to the government and how everyone is just in it for themselves. Again, the CIA does whatever the hell they want for the most part and then you've got the feds and congress and everyone just seems to be in it for their own self interests. I'm sure that's how it works in a lot of governments, but America just seems especially separate and confusing. So many departments are almost warring with one another for control. I can't even imagine what a shit show it is under the Trump admin.\n\nMy theory is that someone had the idea to blackmail people in positions of power because that's always useful, from politicians, to celebrities, to socialites, to bankers, etc. I just remember thinking one day \"what is this, pro bono pimping?? Why is this just a weird island free for all...what kind of human trafficking is all about giving girls to your friends as party favors?\" makes me sick to type that, but that does seem to be what was taking place. I don't think the blackmail in itself was new, but who knows. I think Epstein being \"the guy\" was definitely new/purposeful. He's charismatic and knew Donald Barr aka a former OSS officer and the OSS = precursor to CIA. Barr also wrote a very odd book...especially in the context of all of this.

Yes we should be very careful who we vote for in the case of safeguarding democracy. That being said, the real change comes from primaries. When moderate people leave the major parties which has been happening more and more, they create the dangers of populism as presented by Trump and Mamdhani respectively. If you want someone who is conservative and not trump, show up to primaries. I can hardly blame people for their pessimism but half the game is showing up. My primary claim is that neither party is a moral entity. \nMAGA is also not specific enough. Their are Trump ideologs that everyone thinks of when such a term is brought up, but having talked with many at primaries, beliefs are quite diverse. Is that an excuse, no. Does it require more nuance than this post would allow? yes. \nTo the point of destroying democracy, both parties have been growing more authoritarian. Identity politics is the hallmark of fascism in the fundamental view of fascist political theory. In the writings of Carl Schmitt, it claims that as long as there is an outward group, politics exist, and the outlying group should be annihilated. Call it purity or collectivism, the both lead to major authoritarian regimes which have been growing in both major parties. I know this might not be the post you were looking for, but I don’t believe voting for one side or the other is necessarily evil. I think both sides are wrong, but it the duty of the citizen to hold their parties accountable. I guess this is to say your approach for change is incorrect. If you are not in a party, join th party you hate the least and change it from within. Trump did the exact same thing, and we could do the same. \nSide note:Cozing up to dictators is kind of an American pastime. This is not unusual, installing or supporting dictators that work with the American interest. Overthrowing them is not unusual, especially if we consider that we are entering a multipolar world again. We are not indisputably the sole hegemony anymore. China and Russia are here and it might be time to play the Cold War again. Destroying Monuments is not completely out there, but revisionism is a thing on both sides when interpreting our history. To be fair Trumps interpretation seems exceptionally poor in this area. Also, correct me if I’m wrong, but Trump has yet to sell the oil rights in Venezuela to any “donors.” Such a claim is serious, but I have not seen anything to indicate that specifically with the oil money.

Nearly all of them amount to 'I think this is bad,' which is fair, but completely different from what you're claiming. \n\nArguably, your post shows less care for Democracy than Trump, given that he won a second term with the support of the popular vote. Clearly, the majority agrees with his platform and the actions of his first term, and his second term has been largely more of the same hijinks, so I'm struggling to see where you're getting the idea that he isn't representing the will of the majority that elected him. Given the voting record, saying that he isn't acting Democratically implies that you feel a paternal sense of 'knowing better' than the Democratic will, and that it should be the way you expect regardless of the will of the People.\n\nI think you're using 'Democracy' as a catch-all term for government action that you view as positive for yourself and your co-partisans, which is why I asked how you interpret the word. Using more specific terms, like saying that Trump is illiberal, would better your argument, because *that* is fundamentally true and easy to show.\n\nThe dangerous part of Trump isn't even that he is illiberal; that could be a very good thing, frankly. What is a serious problem is his pandering to the more radical elements of the right, which only serves to broaden affective polarization, legitimize radical positions, and open up our nation to civil war. Worse, this path towards extreme affective polarization leads people to throw the baby out with the bathwater and declare Democracy fundamentally broken, because they aren't getting their way anymore, instead of revealing the downsides (affective polarization and social sorting) that must be accounted for. \n\nAndrew Jackson spent decades railing against the Aristocratic and Executive elements of the original republican Constitution and supporting the People's 'Right to Instruct', and he successfully shifted the American cultural perspective on Democracy towards one of dogmatic exclusivism. Jackson did this specifically so that the politically popular Jacksonian Democrats could take control of government and spread the practice of slavery. Jackson was arguably the most Democratically-supported president we've ever had, and yet he was responsible for some of our worst atrocities. Despite those events, he is still viewed as a 'complicated' president, because his strongly Democratic perspective is held by most Americans today. \n\nHe was so successful at manipulating the People that the Whig Party (which were strong supporters of classical republicanism and maintaining checks on the will of the People) collapsed a couple of decades after the Jacksonians rose to prominence.

Though I worded it incorrectly I meant to say “reversing”. Carter had put a grains embargo USSR and Reagan lifted causing the USSR to once again buy in bulk which immediately destroyed their own attempts to foster domestic production. \n\nIt’s hard to impart the importance of this because in the 1970’s around 25% of total US grain was exported exclusively to the USSR. So when Carter put the grain embargo, USSR tried other sources and heavy investing in domestic production. So Reagan comes a lot and exports tons of grains again creating a shock to their agricultural economics. Their response was “perestroika” a series of social and economic reforms mostly centering around decentralization. These ultimately failed but embolden local ethnic nationalists movements that benefited from the decentralization and were mostly able to breakaway a few years later. \n\nThe fear of the Star Wars program put added stress on their economy to develop a counter system. \n\n\n\n\nSo I wanted to further qualify the tax issue because people still say “taxes were higher back in…” line. There was an excellent study in the 1954 that countered that argument. Based on the tax havens and loopholes available at the time averaged across the tax payer base roughly 20% was going untaxed. This is to say that if you averaged it out the typical tax payer wasn’t paying 20% of their taxes. \n\nNow it couldn’t be true that every American tax payer wasn’t cheating the government by 20%. That’s not realistic even with loopholes and tax havens, the average American wouldn’t even have been that resourceful to do that. The reality was that the top 10-20% or so were paying so little or nothing, that across the entire board it averaged to 20%. And of course Reagan would have known this and essentially tried to be sneaky about doing away with some havens and loopholes but in the media make it seem like taxes were going down. \n\n\nI guess I would have to ask, what does Reaganomics mean to you?

I have various problems with Reagan, but rate him decent enough as far as presidents go. \n\nA lot of liberals blame Reagan for \"killing the middle class\" however I don't blame him for this and see that since then we are overall more materially well off. \n\nIn the early 1970s the US had a robust middle class and a rapidly falling poverty rate. Then two bouts of \"Stagflation\" led to high unemployment and high inflation happening at the same time and largely this led to middle class erosion, not Reagan. Jimmy Carter, in an effort to get inflation under control appointed an aggressive fed chair, who raised interest rates so high he caused a purposeful recession. \n\nThis is what Reagan was dealing with at the beginning of his first term. This could be seen as the US' post WWII economic low. Real wages were lower than they had ever been, and while inflation was better it was still above fed targets and unemployment was high. Crime was skyrocketing and manufacturing jobs were going away leading to urban flight in the rust belt. I feel like Robocop does an excellent job of parodying the 1980s but that's a digression. \n\nAs the economy started to Recover Reagan despite having a reputation for being an arch conservative actually worked with Congress and didn't reduce spending, he actually increased it and used his desire to cut programs as leverage to get even more military spending and tax cuts. While this may seem reckless this acted as a stimulus to the economy  and in recessions a stimulus is good. .\n\n\nAt the same time the US chief geopolitical rival and would-be hegemony the USSR was struggling after their failed Afghanistan campaign and was being outcompeted by the US in an extreme way. They had to direct a lot more of their GDP to military spending just to keep up with the US and needed to find a way to get away from their sluggish command economy, they also didn't want to spend so much effort and resources suppressing dissidents and would-be  break-away nations. So they made reforms, but the reforms came too late and ultimately while the reforms may have improved the lives for their citizens doomed the USSR. This can be attributed to the US economic recovery and increased spending. \n\nReagan was really the first clean break from LBJ's \"Great Society\" however he didn't really end those reforms, he just talked about it, the only real movement towards that was the 1994 Welfare Reform bill which was signed by Clinton and was a mixed bag as it pushed a lot of the responsibility to States and now the GOP has moved away from Reaganism in many ways. Figures like Newt Gingrich, Pat Buchanan, Rush Limbaugh are more influential than Reagan or the Bushes to explain the modern reactionary right. \n\nFurthermore most of the middle class loss was absorbed by the upper classes with some falling into the lower classes. High costs of living in high opportunity areas and the loss of status and warnings for less than college educated white men is what kind of spurred the modern right, and one could partially blame Reagan for this due to his anti-union stances but again that was inevitable as the rest of the world caught up to the US in manufacturing ability and that post war manufacturing economy was never going to last. Also most people did adapt to the changing times and the US is very materially well off. It's just that this is all relative and the US is also a place historically prone to anti-intellectualism, populism, with a history of a race based caste system and the right never needed Reagan to get to where it is now. It was always there, just nascent, hidden in a complex web of political coalitions or outright suppressed in the post war era. The fact that social media is a new form of information sharing means America's own worst impulses show themselves. It's an information technology thing and communication thing way more than a Reagan thing. \n\nThe fact is that liberals have to downplay Reagan just like Conservatives have to downplay Obama both were charismatic figures that had two successful terms that pretty obviously left the country in a better place than they found them in and both were also on the right and left politically. Clinton and Bush Sr were much more centrist and pragmatic and George W. Bush can be summarized as a politician that took Reaganism to an even more extreme degree and presided over an unpopular war and left office with a massive economic boondoggle while also squandering the US's excellent financial position post Clinton. \n\nReagans conservative rhetoric never quite lined up with his actions. He displayed a tendency to be morally gray/just straight immoral and very realpolitik in his foreign policy, but he did preside over a recovery that was not fully divorced from his policies, and his policies helped lead to the US becoming a true world hegemony.

Putin may have had some hand in it, but I’m convinced that narcissism explains everything Trump does. Unfortunately, I have some experience with narcissists, and Trump’s behavior fits the pattern almost perfectly. \n\nSince Trump is a narcissist, he lives under the delusion that he is the greatest and best person in the world of all time. I’m not saying that he is merely egotistical. I am saying he knows he is the greatest and best person of all time the same way most people know that grass is green. For him, it’s an established fact. It’s also the way other narcissists think. \n\nTrump’s delusion manifests itself in several ways, but for this argument the one area we want to focus on is his constant need to win in any situation. It’s easy enough to understand—if you are the greatest and best person of all time, you will win at everything, because if you don’t it means you were beaten by a lesser person. If Trump gets beaten by a lesser person, his worldview would collapse, so he has to preserve his delusion at all times. \n\nFortunately for Trump, he has discovered that there are multiple ways to win. You can also win if you make other people lose. So Trump lies and cheats, and in the process he’s discovered an entirely new way to win. He’s also abandoned things like morality and decency, because once you do, you can win much easier. \n\nNow that we have that framework set up, the reason why Trump wants Greenland is because he sees it as winning. He gets to take away a piece of land from another country, so they lose which is a win for him, he gets to do it over the protests of other nations, and for him being able to do something that other people don’t like and yet can’t stop is another win, and he also gets to use the U.S. military as his personal tool, which places him on the level of Vladimir Putin. Another fun fact about narcissists: they like to have powerful friends. They like to show off these people they know and show how special they are by hanging around them. I think Trump wants to show the world that he’s just as powerful and just as scary as Putin. \n\nTrump also doesn’t value NATO. He doesn’t believe in cooperation, because the greatest and best person in the world doesn’t need help. NATO also may tell Trump he can’t do something, and if they were to do that then NATO would be better than Trump, which means he isn’t the greatest and best person in the world. \n\nSo I’m pretty sure Trump sees Greenland as a penultimate win. The ultimate win, though, would be annexing Canada. \n\nMy personal theory is that Trump is dying and he knows it. He’s making changes to the White House, he’s putting his name on buildings and he’s building a monument to himself. He’s talked about making it into heaven, so I think he’s building a monument to all things Trump, and what would be the biggest monument of all? A new large piece of land, probably renamed “Trumpland.” \n\nWhen Trump says it’s psychologically very important to own Greenland, he’s talking about HIS psychology. He desperately wants Greenland so he can take his place as the most consequential President in modern history. And if it destroys the United States and NATO, so what? It’s not like he values cooperation and it’s not like he’ll suffer any consequences.", "author": "Hysteria625", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768709648.0}, {"id": "o066jlt", "post_id": "1qfnlxq", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": "[removed]", "author": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "created_utc": 1768683295.0}, {"id": "o0a8gzo", "post_id": "1qfnlxq", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": "Trump currently is the proverbial dog that chances cars, and when he catches them, he doesn't know what to do with them.  \n\nConsider Venezuela.

It's not that he just wants the territory for mineral rights etc, quite frankly it's just a ruse to try and spin a reason to push for more Tariffs on those that disagree with him.  Those Tariffs are what he's really after in the short term as that will fund all the car chasing he can come up with.\n\nMost of the world had done deals for the previous tariffs, if Trump pushes for more then it will likely undermine the good faith of any previous agreements which could nullify all Tariffs in the future (and the ones he's already got)\n\nEven if he got Greenland, he'd end up with the same problem that the private sector will not want to touch it with a barge pole.

They have the power to lobby for and change laws in their favor. The behavior usually gets our attention, making it look like most or all of them do that. \nIt may seem they're forcing us to live in that society, and to a point that's true, but we have powers to change that. \n\n\n\nThere were 147,950 ultra wealthy individuals in the US in 2024. That out of 350m people. How many can you name that are criminals?  Or have had their jobs stolen by an undocumented immigrant? The wealthy discriminate because the other classes are in their way, asking for money to make their situation better because it's impossible to do on their own. (Help with food, lowering cost of living, seeking protection.) They don't agree with their views on the survival of this country while also bettering their situation.  Many of the ultra wealthy get kinda selfish about sharing in the form of releasing funding and creating social safety nets to help them. They feel they have no obligation. They hold the purse strings, and it's not in their best interest. \n\n\nYour theory is compelling because the issues are ones we all share, and we want to look at ways for that to change. However, you could say the same thing about any 2 groups. \n\n\nEg: Drivers of cars tend to look down on motorcyclists who don't wear helmets and who weave through traffic. The motorcyclists say drivers don't use their seat belts, they play the radio too loud, and other distractions. They each have an issue with the other. Motorcyclists are stuck with the driver's actions and the dangers that come with it, but they could lobby for stricter enforcement and changes in laws. \n\n\nIn addition to the lopsided facts, drivers can afford to own the highways. There are many more of them, leaving the motorcyclists to be put in a bad light because there's so few. If one causes an accident, then another one does and maybe a third, it seems like they're all doing it even though drivers have many more accidents.\n BTW If an ultra wealthy biker was captured by a phone camera weaving through traffic they would have a chance at becoming a media headline. People love to hate things they envy. So it would seem like more do it simply because we heard  so much about it. And because we envy them. If they caught another and a third, those would also be headlines in media and appear like we really have a problem we need to solve. I can picture it: \"A growing number of the wealthy put others in danger.\" Discussions might arise to decide if they should be allowed to own motorcycles. \n\n\nYou can see how there are exaggerations in there. For one, many motorcyclists do wear helmets and many drivers do wear seat belts. That's one issue I have with your view. It's not accurate. \n\n\nIt's also skewed. Seemingly every ultra wealthy person travels, owns islands, and have very expensive schools. One could say they do that because they're hypocrites. But it's just normal behavior. They're doing their own thing. Not to look down others and certainly not to steal their vices. If you had the money,  you might too, and you'd want your family to have those things. 'My family is going on vacation to our apartment in Japan\"' vs '\"My family is going on vacation to Disney World.\" We all want what's best. The fact that there is income disparity, might make the last group envious,  and they want the wealthy to share. 'It's not fair that I can't afford it.'\n\n\nI realize there's many more points than what's in my scenarios, but given time, I could probably come up with just as many parallels as yours, resulting in a picture forming that agrees with the idea originally in my head.  Why? Because I stapled together a bunch of similar but independent statistics. \n\n\nWe know racism exists,  but that is from both the middle and lower income classes as well as the ultra wealthy. It seems like the top earners are much worse than their lower income neighbors, mostly because they are in the spotlight and scrutiny is higher, not because there are more of them. Right now, MAGA has brought out the racists from every class and told them it's okay to openly say what they feel. They've created new ones from weak people who've been talked into it.  But MAGA has all classes. \n\n\n\nEach side has issues that need to be addressed. As a whole, if they've divided them selves into groups who each blame the other, all they have are less people to work on solutions. ", "author": "Brilliant_Cheetah608", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1770962392.0}, {"id": "o4yiend", "post_id": "1r2ao8o", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": "There is absolutely no evidence that the ultrawealthy commit more crimes than the poor or average people.

They are (in order of cruciality):\n\n1) Once a person enters a field, their knowledge is locked and does not / cannot evolve as the field does.\n\n2) The job one gets as a teenager / new college grad is in the career field one remains in for the rest of their life.\n\n3) In order to be a \"productive member of society\" one MUST be engaged in a career.\n\n  \nFor point #2, Very few people get their \"forever job\" fresh out of college. With the exception of a few factory type jobs, people just don't hire on at a place and work at that same place for the next 40 years.  They work someplace and develop skills, then move to a new place to use those skills and develop other skills.  In this way, their skill set is always evolving - and they also move and follow the job market wherever it may go.  There are absolutely niche fields where things just go away entirely, but almost all fields can be broken down into skill sets - and those skill sets can be applied to other fields, even if they need to be applied in a different manner. If you are at the top of your game as a pharmaceutical salesperson, and that industry dries up, you can still take those sales skills, re-tool (and re-knowledge yourself) and go into real estate, or computer sales, or new-emerging-technology-that-is-the-next-big-thing sales.  If you are an accountant specializing in real estate, and real estate dries up, you can retool (and re-knowledge yourself) and specialize in pharmaceutical sales - or just generalize.  And so on.\n\n  \nAnd point #1 builds on this.  Even if you DO stay in the same field, you SHOULD be keeping up with the technology as it emerges.  Sure, if you are still trying to be a legal secretary but refuse to use a computer, and insist on paper notes and paper files and typing up every single document - including re-typing when one word in a clause is altered - then you are not going to make it.  But assuming that you have kept up with the technology, and continue to learn things as the field develops and evolves, then you can remain relevant in a field for a very long time.\n\n  \nFinally regarding point #3, \"job hopping\" has been a thing for a while now, albeit a rather frowned upon/uncommon thing until recently.  But younger millennials, and now Gen Z have made this the new \"job model\" going forward.  Tying in with point #2, there is absolutely no reason to believe that what you go to college for / where you start your career is where you can, will, or even should end your working life.  Yes, you rightly point out that older folks face discrimination in the job market (despite this being blatantly illegal, at least in the US).  But this is also in part due to the \"oldheads\" at the top of the job market not having \"caught up\" with this emerging trend.  As millennials age up and as they can positions at the top, that bias (I suspect) will largely disappear.  The sheer number of folks looking for a job in their 40s and 50s will demand a shift.\n\n  \nNow, for the anecdotal evidence.  Yes, I understand my story is anecdotal, and does not PROVE anything, but.....\n\n\n\nI am nearing the mid-century mark.  I am retired from my first career, and have spent about 4 years as a social worker.  I kind of fell into that, and do not want that to be my \"retirement\" career - but if that is the way things shake out, so be it.  My first career has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with social work - about as far from it as possible.  And neither does my college degree, which is in General Studies.  The only reason I even fell into Social Work is that there is currently a critical shortage of social workers, so they opened hiring up to ANY degree, no longer requiring a specific social work (or related) degree.  This will always be the case.  I was able to take my skillset from one career field and transfer it to a new career field (point #2).  While in my first career field, I kept up with technology, in general, with the reality of the wider world, and, once in social work, with changes in policy and cultural relations, to stay abreast of my new field (point #1).

It was founded on a specific set of written documents (The Declaration, The Constitution) that explicitly define its legitimacy through the rule of law, sanctity of contract, and property rights.\n\nIf a Comanche war party raided a settlement or another tribe, they were acting in accordance with a warrior ethos that prioritized bravery, resource acquisition, and tribal defense. There was no Comanche \"Constitution\" declaring all men created equal that they were violating.\n\nWhen the United States broke treaties, stole land via eminent domain fraud, or ignored Supreme Court rulings, it wasn't just acting like a conqueror. It was actively dismantling the very thing it claimed gave it the right to exist: its own laws.\n\nAnd what really bothers me about this part of the downthread is this: if you say that the American land theft was justified by \"all nations conquer, it's the way of the world\" you're saying that you don't actually believe in our founding principles. That's what really rankles -- how eager people are to jettison the ideals, the founding proposition, and the Constitution itself when confronted with evidence that we haven't lived up to them.\n\nWhat I am arguing is that you cannot, with consitency, hold these two beliefs simultaneously\n\n1. \"The United States is an exceptional nation founded on liberty, equality, and the rule of law.\"\n2. \"The United States was justified in stealing land because strong nations conquer weak ones.\"\n\nIf you really believe #1, like me, recognizing failures to live up to those ideals is NECESSARY: we claimed to be a nation of laws. We broke those laws. To be true patriots, we must acknowledge that failure so we can strive to live up to the ideals again.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you believe #2, you're saying that to you, the Declaration of Independence is just marketing fluff. If this is what you believe, I respectfully suggest that your patriotism is shallow and your loyalty is to your tribe, not to our founding principles.  \n\n\nNow, having said that, I can comment on the slogan \"No one is illegal on stolen land.\"\n\nCritics dismiss this as a \"woke\" claim that borders shouldn't exist. I see it differently. I see it as a reminder of the two things we must do to actually live up to our own proposition:\n\n\"No one is illegal\": This isn't about open borders; it’s about personhood. Under our system, rights are inherent to the human being, not granted by the state. An undocumented person is still a person, entitled to due process and basic rights. When we use \"illegal\" as a noun, we dehumanize them to make it easier to bypass those rights.\n\n\"On stolen land\": This is the caution. We justified the original theft by dehumanizing the Native Americans (\"savages\") so we could feel good about violating our own treaties. The slogan reminds us that we have a history of ignoring our own laws when dealing with \"The Other.\"\n\nThe point isn't that we \"have no right\" to enforce borders. The point is that because we failed our principles so badly in the past, we have a heightened moral obligation to get it right this time. We need to respect the humanity of the people here now, even if we deny their claim to stay, because that is what a nation of laws—a nation that is actually \"civilized\"—is supposed to do.\n\nThat's what I think, anyway.", "author": "hipchecktheblueliner", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1770304990.0}, {"id": "o3nhmvd", "post_id": "1qw945p", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": "If I stole your house tomorrow by kidnapping you and putting you on a boat to Uganda, that would be ok, right?", "author": "TerryFinallyBackedUp", "score": -16, "created_utc": 1770260727.0}, {"id": "o3o1596", "post_id": "1qw945p", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": "Cool, you believe it's stolen land.

There is no longer a \"right of conquest\", that part in history has come to an end, like slavery did, and we want to build a new future where that does not happen.\n\nTurn it around: when you say \"that's what empires do\" - will you gleefully repeat this statement when the same happens to you? For instance, if in twenty years' time, an alliance of Chinese, ex-Commonwealth and EU were to take the occupy 100 miles in from each coast of the US, and told you that you need to leave, will you just pack up and say \"oh well, it's what empires do\"? The land acknowledgement is part of constructed reality that should prevent that sort of thing from happening - at least, hopefully. \n\nThe alternative, not acknowledging the land, has consequences. For instance, many my own Turkey will cheerfully remind you that the West is the most genocidal of them all: after all, it is hard to beat a record where the expansion of the British and Spanish empires cleared three continents of peoples. Many in Turkey find it difficult to discuss issues like the Armenian Genocide partly because of this. If this is \"what empires do\", then yeah, Ottomans to it to others as well. In fact, why restrain to history? If America did it, and got rich because they stole some land, then by what principle can you tell any other country to not do it? If nobody acknowledges that it was criminal behavior, then it was not criminal behavior. Then it is OK for others to do the same elsewhere, in this moment, so that their preferred ethnicity and religion gets territory and resources.\n\nWhat is the point? Other than being able to give legitimacy to the existing country, the USA, \"Giving back the land\" is actually a viable alternative. That does not mean that people's houses or property is disowned, it may mean that sovereign political entities may appear, or existing governing bodies may incorporate tribal leaders. This sounds radical to many, but a land acknowledgement lays down the foundations of finding such solutions.\n\nFinally, any country has to prove its legitimacy to its own citizens and to other countries. Failing to do so eventually creates a hollowed-out state: it exists with momentum, but in its final moments, nobody is interested in being part of it. (Consider for a second that at some point in very recent history, millions of people simply stopped calling themselves \"citizens of the British Empire\", and the same happened with \"Ottomans\" - the names simply went down the drain. In the case of the British Empire, this happened without even losing a war. Do you want the political entity you were born in to continue?

To own land, you either need the personal capacity to defend it from anyone else who wants it, or you need to exist within a governmental framework that uses its own monopoly on violence to protect your claim. If you have neither the strength to hold the territory nor a state to enforce your deed, you don't own the land: you’re just occupying it until someone more organized arrives.\n\n\nCalling the United States \"stolen\" intentionally ignores the reality of conquest, which has been the primary driver of human geography since the dawn of time. Before a single European ship ever hit the coast, North America was a shifting mosaic of territories won and lost through brutal tribal warfare, enslavement, and displacement. Labeling the eventual European expansion as \"theft\" while treating prior indigenous conquests as \"heritage\" is a massive intellectual inconsistency; and flattens the rich tradition of countless indigenous peoples into populist pablum. \n\n\nTheft is an illegal act that occurs within a stable, shared legal system.

And you're dismissing some awful post-independence crimes.\n\n\n\nBritain was in an intense 100+ year conflict with France, and had a complicated Native policy in north America. Colonists didn't care, they just wanted land. They expanded autonomously, the British government didn't annex any territory on the mainland and were often a restraining influence.\n\nAfter the 7 Years War, Britain agreed to halt all colonization West of Appalachia. At this point the Virginia colony (and esp the richest founders) claimed huge tracts of land, which weren't even fully mapped yet. They actually appealed to the king to override Parliament and break treaty obligations! Anyone saying they were anti-monarchist is lying; they were happy to scrap the British Constitution and have an absolute monarchy if it meant they got their land claims.\n\nThere are other examples leading to independence, but basically the British always worried about France and colonists always worried about regulations, taxes, and land. That's why the USA exists.\n\nAs for natives, they didn't have a uniform concept of land ownership anyway. A lot of it was focused on temporary access to resources and trade networks, and sure there was plenty of coercion involved. Sometimes huge groups of tribes would travel hundreds or thousands of miles, drive animals extinct with different hunting techniques, and assimilate or exterminate local cultures. That happened in the El Paso region, it killed the last of the megafauna there. And Western Europeans didn't really have firm borders until the 1500s, partly because of the Reformation and partly because of colonization. A French prince could own castles with armies in Spain and Austria, and may or may not have to follow the local laws and customs. Many lawsuits were fought over the right to collect grain taxes from mills, because taxes were based on customs and obligations, not territory in a modern sense.\n\nBut most importantly, the US did plenty of crimes post-independence. The Trail of Tears wasn't the British' fault, it was Jackson's. As an enlightened, free, talk-the-good-talk country, the US broke a lot of promises and murdered millions of people.

A lot of the founders (especially Jefferson and Washington) had huge stakes, where they'd \"claim\" millions of acres that weren't even fully mapped yet, then speculate on those claims in an open market. All this violated British colonial policy, parliamentary regulations, and treaty obligations. When some tribes appealed to the British government which chastised the colonists, the founders wrote to the king. They wanted the king to override his own parliament and government! That's abandoning the British Constitution and pushing for absolute monarchy.\n\nSo any narrative that the war of independence was about rejecting monarchy is absolutely wrong, and maybe an intentional lie. It was about taxes, regulations, and most importantly land. Different colonies had different issues with those concerns, and very different relations with individual tribes. But the colonies expanded more or less autonomously and the British government didn't \"annex\" territory, they were usually a restraining force that the colonists resented due to their conflict with France and complicated native policy.", "author": "Current_Till_5962", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1770336341.0}, {"id": "o3v2ha4", "post_id": "1qw945p", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": "Oh, the United States certainly stole land from native people.

Ukraine between 1991-2014 was politically divided between its Pro-European nationalist west and relatively more Pro-Russian and less nationalist east. There was a real chance that long-term Ukraine would fall back into Russia's sphere of influence. That will not be the case following this war. A Pro-Russian politician like Yanukovych will not come to power to Ukraine for a long, long time. Speaking Russian in Ukraine is now considered a grave sin. From my experience, even the Ukrainians on the far east who spoke Russian for generations have all switched over to Ukrainian. Whatever cultural bond existed between Russians and Ukrainians after the USSR's collapse is gone. Ukraine is now a nation with a unique history, a war-hardened military capable of stopping its gravest enemy, and a national identity undeniably distinct from Russia's.\n\nThis isn't true. There is indeed a very large pro-West bloc of the population that's in control of the government, which is attempting to build a nationalist project built on rejecting its Russian connection, but even now, almost 4 years into the war, [Russian is a huge part of Ukraine's culture.](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-russian-language-education-pop-culture-kyiv/a-74931328) \n\nThe fact that people avoid speaking Russian in public is a sign of a country that's in the middle of great internal turmoil. Not a country that has \"solved\" its national question.\n\n> Instead of fragmenting NATO, Putin expanded and hardened it. Finland and Sweden joined only because of his invasion further exposing Russia's border with the West. European countries which have been largely demilitarized and pacifist for decades have finally started making serious investment into their militaries and national security. There was a real chance Donald Trump might've ditched Europe for Russia. It is very difficult to see that happening now with America having strong economic interests in protecting Ukraine's rare minerals and buying Ukraine's drones. Worst of all, Russia will likely now face a strong, war-hardened, stringently Anti-Russian Ukrainian military right at its border for the remainder of the century. Ukraine coming back to restore its lost land will now be a constant threat.\n\nFinland and Sweden were de-facto NATO members already. Both have participated in NATO missions and oversea pro-West deployments since the Cold War. This is the de-facto reality Russia has operated under for years. You could say that the situation has marginally worsened for Russia, in a sense that the Northern flank has a pretty explicit obligation to contributes towards a potential war, but again... this has largely been the reality Russia has operated under for years. So the strategic picture did not meaningfully change. \n\nAlso, the Russian military has had to deal with the Ukrainian military pre-2022. Ukraine explicitly made joining NATO its goal since 2014, and almost all of Russia's new military deployments 2014-2022 have been on its Ukrainian border. So again, something that happened prior to the war. \n\n> Instead of solidifying Russia as a major power, Putin solidified Russia as China's junior partner. Russia's economy is now smaller than Italy's and is completely isolated on the world stage. Financially, it now relies almost entirely on China buying its oil. China has changed its purchasing terms multiple times already and every time Putin bends the knee. He knows that if China stops buying his oil, Russia is done for. He is now Xi's puppet in all but name. \n\nRussia's best chance of being a mjor power is only as China's partner. Whether it's as a \"junior\" or \"senior\" partner is largely irrelevant unless you're trying to score Internet points. The alliance between China and Russia secures Russia's Eastern flank. In fact, the two are so comfortable with each other, that the Russian military has essentially emptied its Eastern border as the war with Ukraine intensified. \n\n> With a third of the federal budget going to fund the war, inflation and interest rates reached double-digits and living standards for any Russian outside of Moscow or St Petersburg completely collapsed. Lastly, Russia's only real pre-war asset - its military which Putin has been building for decades - was greatly weakened in Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands (if not a million) Russians died on the battlefield. With each passing year, Putin has extensively needed to rely on North Korean, Iranian, African, and Chinese fighters more and more. It will take decades to restore Russia's pre-war military strength and Russia will not seriously threaten anybody again for a long time.\n\nRussian wage growth has outstripped inflation. In fact, the Russian economy hasn't been this healthy in years. There are a lot of problems, esepcially structural ones in the Russian economy, but this isn't a uniquely Russian problem. Every single economy on Earth has structural problems and business cycles. In fact, the last recession we had in United States was as recent as 2020, with major financial sector issues as recetnyl as 2022. \n\nQuite frankly, living standards in Russia, especially outside of Moscow and St.Petersburg, have seen some of the biggest cash injections thanks to Russia's recrutiment drive, as well as major investments in its industry. \n\nFinally, the war in Ukraine is far from being decided. Russia very much has a say in how this war ends, as did the West. The current contest sees Russia prevailing at the battlefield, and while people laugh at \"meters gained\", World War 1 didn't end with trench warfare. It didn't end with tanks as wunderwaffen that allowed the Allies to roll over Germany either. \n\nTo sum it all up, in 5 years we may end up at the following situation.\n\n1) NATO seriously weakened by Trump's presidency.\n2) Russia victorious in Ukraine. \n3) Russian economy stronger than ever.\n4) Russia's ties with China in an even better place with far better cooperation between the two (that's a huge threat)\n\nSo don't be so quick to write off Russia.

Trump never gets reelected if he's running against an ordinary Democrat, rather than a Biden who should have retired in 2022 and a Kamala who only ran half a campaign that was essentially Biden 2.0, in the eyes of voters.\n\nWhat would cause a civil war in the United States is if Trump or this regime attempt to compromise the upcoming elections. Trump and the GOP may be hugely unpopular, but they've shown a willingness to use violent force and a desire to seize unilateral control over the polling process.\n\nIf Trump attempts that, or even another January 6th, you can be sure there will be violence. But the scale of that is hard to say. Again, it's s bold to be certain there *won't* be violence, when the violence, assassinations, and protests are already happening.", "author": "RoadKiehl2", "score": 12, "created_utc": 1770089884.0}, {"id": "o3fpxjg", "post_id": "1qub7l9", "subreddit": "changemyview", "body": "They are certainly going to attempt that.

Obviously being mentioned in the Epstein files isn't _legal proof_ of guilt. I don't think there is any meaningful movement suggesting that everyone merely named in the files be thrown into prison on that evidence alone.  I have no doubt you can find _someone_ who believes this but the Lizardman constant holds here.\n\nBut being in the files is, to some extent, an indication of a connection with Epstein. Some connections are innocent: for example, John Stewart is in there but only as a topic of discussion.  Other people corresponded with Epstein directly: that's a closer connection.  Pandora Music email support, for example, provided him with his password.  The only thing that makes Pandora guilty of is terrible password storage practices.  \n\nSome were regular correspondents: still closer.  And so on.\n\nNot everyone who Epstein ever emailed knew what was going on. But the closer the connection with Epstein the more likely they did.  Again, this does not rise to the level of proof necessary to send someone to prison, but it probably does surpass the level where you might not want to leave your 10 year old daughter alone with those people.\n\nThis is what I mean by \"proof\" being a difficult word.
