I always thought 3 Js was my limit… but somehow I’ve been juggling 4 for the last four months. A lot of lessons learned along the way.\n\nTC: \\~440k\n\nJ1 - Been here three years. It's a little meeting heavy, but most are big group calls where I don't need to actively participate. I use AI tools to take notes. I don’t care if people think I’m too quiet. There’s also a teammate who volunteers for literally everything and loves overachieving, so I just let her take the spotlight. She makes 15k more than I do but probably does 20% more work. Not worth it to me. I just make sure to meet expectations and deliver on time.\n\nJ2 - This one’s annoying because the manager is a bit micromanaging. The only good thing is that most of the team is in a different time zone, so meeting conflicts aren’t too bad.\n\nJ3 - My favorite so far. Manager values efficiency and work‑life balance. Not the highest paying, but it's very light on meetings and the workload is chill.\n\nJ4 - Been here four months. Manager is nice but he never ends meeting on time. I have to schedule at least an hour between calls so we don’t run over.\n\nWork Tactics:\n\n\\#1 Separate hardware for each server. It obviouly goes with saying - separate phones, speakers, mice, mouse jigglers, etc. The only shared item is my Logitech keyboard that switches between devices.\n\n\\#2 Stay on top of calendar. Keep a to‑do list so you know what to priorize.\n\n\\#3 On busy days with 10+ meetings (especially Monday), I set an alarm to make sure I don’t miss something.\n\n\\#4 Clean desk = clean brain. A messy desk kills productivity. I bought a bunch of organizers and cable management stuff. Makes a huge difference.\n\n\\#5 With 4 servers meeting conflicts is unavoidable. I don’t trust wireless earbuds, so I use wired ones - left ear for one meeting, right ear for another. Have excuses ready (e.g. wifi issues, eating, dog barking) so you don’t need to be on camera for both.\n\n\\#6 Learn the job and manager fast. Figure out routines and expectations early. I dropped a server last year after 3 months because the systems were dinasour and the manager was disorganized. It had pretty good benefits but it was eaing up too much of my time and not OE‑friendly at all.\n\n\\#7 Use AI for everything you can. Notes, brainstorming, data analysis, workflow automation, performance reviews… AI has saved me so much time and stress.\n\nNutrition & Mental Health:\n\n\\#1 Invest in your health. I spent a few hundred on a nutritionist last year and honestly it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Invest in nutrition, chiro, physical therarpy, supplements if needed. OE is mentally and physically draining if you’re not taking care of yourself.\n\n\\#2 Outsource whatever you can. Takeout, cleaning, whatever buys back time.\n\n\\#3 Treat yourself sometimes. As long as it’s not a long‑term financial commitment, go get the nice meal, the massage, the vacation.

Different companies, different systems, no shared access, no overlapping duties. OE worked fine… until it didn’t.\n\nRecently, one employer (J1) started:\n\n\t•\tMicromanaging hard\n\n\t•\tQuestioning performance and “integrity”\n\n\t•\tPulling HR into meetings\n\nHR formally emailed me asking if I work for my other employer by name and cited a Conflict of Interest policy that requires disclosure and approval of outside employment. They’re sending a COI form via DocuSign and want a yes/no answer in writing.\n\nContext that matters:\n\n\t•\tI’ve had J2 before returning to J1 (this isn’t a new job)\n\n\t•\tJ1 policy requires disclosure/approval of outside employment\n\n\t•\tHR hasn’t accused me of wrongdoing yet, but the tone is very “we already know”\n\n\t•\tI strongly suspect disclosure = forced choice or termination\n\n\t•\tMy mental bandwidth is shot and this situation is now bleeding into performance at the other job\n\nImportant note: Unemployment is not a deciding factor for me.

J1 I’ve been at for 5 years and is going well and primarily as working with offshore and EST time zones being in PST. It’s fully remote with a little bit of travel but got boring and easy. J2 started last April with a recruiter reaching out and helping me interview and secure a job at a startup. J2 seemed very promising and was easy, with the only issue being an annoying manager who would ping me 2x a week with “quick chat” messages. I got pretty disengaged starting in the new year as I could tell my responsibilities were lowering but I wanted to stay at this j as long as possible because the salary was super solid and it was 10 hours a week at work, mostly afternoon PST which overlapped great with my J1.

There was so much potential  to make money and also possibility for jobs clashing in some format or another. \n\nAs I look back on my experience, I question if there are things I’ve come across that I wish were suggested in the beginning. Since I have some time to share my experience today, I figured I’d pass along what works for me. \n\n1 - Prioritization - For me this was the #1 thing I needed to immediately develop. With task across multiple positions, failure to accurately prioritize work could easily result in a missed deadline. A daily to-do list, mapping out your next day ahead of time, Sunday night planning, whatever it takes. \n\n2 - Ambition - 40 hours a week is a goal, not a a concrete schedule. So many people say you’re “doing OE wrong” by putting in extra hours, but if you need the time to catch up, putting in some extra hours can even make you appear as ambitious to your leadership team and make you more valued.\n\n3 - Delay-Send (For Emails) - This has been a game changer for helping space out my productivity across the day. By scheduling emails to go out at certain times I can be more proactive and less reactive throughout my day. \n\n4 - Avoid Exposure - If camera-off meetings are an option, always opt for that. Also distinct and unusual backgrounds for Teams/Zoom makes you more memorable when you are on cam. Don’t put your profile picture on company Intranets or Teams messenger. Don’t volunteer for Employee Resource Groups or large group projects.\n\n5 - Start a Regimen & Minimize Options - This has changed not only my career, but my life. I’m so high functioning throughout the day that keeping a routine of a daily workout at the exact same time regardless of workload, or minimizing outfit selection choices I have everyday has really cut corners on saving time. Even minimizing dinner options (while still ensuring a balanced diet) has helped. \n\n6 - Perspective - Whether you are a W-2 Waged employee or 1099 etc., stop viewing yourself as an employee for the company and start viewing your employers as your clients. Your job is to keep both your clients happy with your work so seek ways to improve communications with or offer reassurances to leadership, or look for training opportunities. This shows your clients that you’re invested. \n\nJust little things that have helped me succeed over my own career.

My FT had a leadership transition two months into the job (I'm a year in now) where the ED was let go and one of the staff stepped into the interim role. She was fine as a colleague but she's a narcissist as a boss. Demanding, demeaning, and deflects blame to staff. We're a small team too, so each of us wears multiple hats. Instead of slowing down when we're understaffed, she was full speed ahead.\n\nI'm seriously thinking of letting go of the FT and making my PT J FT. On the PT side, my supervisor is kind, trusting, reasonable, and everything i could ask for in an employer. None of the staff seem overworked or overwhelmed. The company actually respects work-life-balance. It's a larger company and is much more stable. When I proposed going FT, my supervisor was thrilled and has already reached out to HR about next steps. \n\nHere are the parts I'm struggling with:\n1. Even by turning the PT into FT, I'd be taking a significant pay cut. \n2. We'd have to go on partner's insurance coverage so that we can keep our PCPs but that means another 1.5k deducted monthly. \n\nWe're looking at about $4-5k less/month. \n\nI just don't want to disappoint the family and also worried about finances. We'd be able to make ends meet, but we were finally starting to feel like we could get ahead. \n\nEdit: really appreciate all the suggestions Reddit peeps\n\nEdit 2 - UPDATE: J1 (originally PT) offered FT, effective Monday.

I rode it out for as long as I could, but I cannot tolerate it any more. \n\nSo, with my additional revenue, I started a company. We built and designed a product that helps eliminate chronic pain. I just closed a large deal with the VA, and it starts 3/1. By 6/1, I’ll have more $$ coming in that both my js ever did.\n\nThe thing is, I just got approved to purchase a home. I have the savings for the down payment and everything, but having 2 W2s is helping me get approved. I’m afraid if I lose one of my W2s, I will no longer be able to buy. If I don’t buy now, I’ll have to buy as an entrepreneur, which may take 2-3 years to qualify again. \n\nSo, should I just find a low stress j2 for the W2 and additional revenue, or just see what happens with the house hunting? Maybe I don’t buy the house and wait for the VA to ramp up and buy 3 years down the road? \n\nSince my new company is a manufactured product, my only role is to ensure that product is delivered to my distributor, so I don’t spend more than 10 hours a week on it.

When do you leave?", "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am a senior software consultant going on four years at the same employer. I also freelance for other companies on the side, which nets me a nice second salary. We’re going to call that second salary J2. My employer (J1) is a digital marketing agency/consultancy that also provides their own home-grown enterprise level CMS products, as well as does boutique custom/full stack development for clients.\n\nI’ve recently been going through a conundrum on whether or not to leave my current employer for a job offer I already have in my hands (new J1).\n\nFor starters, my current employer is a “lifestyle” company. Mainly a hands-off management style, we’re allowed a wide swath of freedom: when we work, how we work, unlimited sick time / vacation time, average pay, etc.\n\nIn the last couple years, this employer has been facing an economic downturn and clamping down. We had layoffs in 2023/2024 as many other companies did, but things never quite recovered. My personal job has always been the custom full stack development/consulting for clients that don’t fit into the company’s CMS/Digital Strategy model. This part of the business has severely contracted since I started in 2022, and is highly isolated.\n\nFor a while now, as the custom development consultant, I’ve been expected to do Sales, Support, Project Management, and Development for each client, one man army style. The only thing I didn’t do was write the SOW’s.\n\nRecently, the rhetoric of management has changed significantly for my role. We are now trying to squeeze custom clients for as many hours as we can, and take as many new clients on as we can. For a long time this strategy was fine but it’s breaking down with the squeeze. I am having to now come up with hours to charge the client that I normally wouldn’t pose (i.e. “let’s integrate AI into your app that has no business using it!”). I feel like a snake for this.\n\nThe lifestyle aspects have been severely negated by this strategy as well. For instance, I was forced to work 14 hours in one day last week because a client’s site was down and I was the only person with even a remote ability to fix it given my isolation level. I haven’t taken a vacation since July last year, because I don’t feel like I’m able to.\n\nOn top of this, during my last annual review in 2025, I did not receive a raise, and management brought up issues from 3 years ago as well as company unprofitability as the reasons. I then began to “Manage the Managers”, by setting up bi-weekly calls to have them explain EXACTLY what the issue is, and to elaborate on it bi-weekly. I put myself on a PIP lol. I suspect this is economic pressure from management though, it is always cheaper to have someone leave on their own than to lay them off.\n\nOverall, I feel like the “lifestyle” in this Lifestyle company is cooked from the pressure management is feeling. Additionally, given the economic pressure, I’m not really sure this is a good fit anymore. What’s the point of being able to have freedom if it’s synthetic?\n\nAt this point, this new job offer with better benefits, better pay, yet a more a stringent work-life balance, doesn’t even need to be explained. It can’t be any worse than this, no? Bearing in mind management from current company also did not have an answer from the first week of health insurance this year, has held previously laid off people in a limbo state for their severance, and has told me “you wouldn’t be the first person to be laid off” after all of this.

This isn’t a setting where clarity, fairness, or loyalty reliably protect you. It’s a setting where organizational priorities have shifted, and individual circumstances—tenure, performance, personal stability—carry limited weight.\n\nWhat *does* matter next is composure, documentation, and timing. Not everything needs to be said in the moment. Not every reaction improves outcomes. Preserving credibility and optionality becomes the priority.\n\nYour observation about multiple income streams isn’t cynical—it’s adaptive. Many people don’t diversify income out of greed; they do it because organizational commitments are increasingly conditional. Restructuring makes that plain.\n\nAnd the lack of immediate financial stress you mention? That’s not luck—that’s resilience.

So I can wrap up each piece of work neatly and wash my hands of it, and if they ever let me go, who cares? I'm a contractor. I expect it at any time. They know it, I know it.

People leave, ignore the order, or show up in the office only a few times and then gradually return to the old way once things have settled, until the next email is sent out.\n\nThe core issue is that enforcement is difficult without risking talent loss, especially for highly skilled or hard-to-replace employees. Management often underestimates how much leverage parts of the workforce gained during the remote-first period. When faced with the choice between losing key people or quietly tolerating non-compliance, many companies choose the latter.\n\nAs a result, RTO mandates tend to become symbolic rather than operational. They exist on paper, but day-to-day behavior barely changes. Over time, this erodes trust in leadership decisions and makes future mandates even harder to implement.

It was an accounting manager job. I ended up hating pretty much everything about it. The pay was really bad. About 20% under the market rate for that type of position. I accepted anyway because it was remote and I wanted to OE.\n\nMy boss a director was a micro-manager. She constantly monitored my teams status. If I was away for more than a few minutes I'd get asked about it (this was before I knew about mouse movers). She was also the kind of person who wanted to have meetings over every little thing. Meetings over topics that could have been 2 emails.\n\nOne of my direct reports constantly tried to argue with me over my review notes on her work. Telling me she was trained to do it a certain way when it was clearly wrong. I had a really hard time hiring for a senior accountant to join my team. No one decent would accept the terrible pay. I mentioned this to my boss. She refused to budge on what I could offer people. We finally got one who interviewed well. After a couple months she stopped working. Literally went days without doing anything. I highly suspect she was OE too, but still do the f-ing job.\n\nMy boss's boss the senior director was the most talkative person I've ever met. Every meeting with her always went 10-15 minutes over because she wouldn't stop talking. It just became understood that you shouldn't schedule a meeting immediately after one she was in because you'd be late the second meeting. It was incredibly annoying. When I started she greatly emphasized that she wanted new ideas and new perspectives on their processes. I gave her some things that could easily be improved. She didn't listen to any of it. All of the ideas were immediately dismissed. I gave up on trying and realized my only option was to just deal with it.\n\nThe amount they wanted me to review every month was insane. Everyone on my team had 3-4 companies they did the accounting for. Each had around 35 monthly balance sheet recs + approx 30 journal entries per month, and variance commentary I had to review. Hundreds of items per month.\n\nEventually I had enough. The stress wasn't worth the extra income so I quit.

So, it's easier when I tell them I am unemployed.   I can always say I had odd other contract jobs, and I have a spouse who works.   They buy it.    The reality is, I have manged to keep myself working, and in reality there were no gaps, but there was a LOT of overlap with 3 J's ... now down to two J's.\n\nThis time, when I send out my resume, I'll add my contract job, and tell them I am unemployed again, although in reality, I still have 2 J's and they don't have to know that.", "author": "Huge_Road_9223", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1769090092.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.7434684038162231, "compound_score": -0.0655, "scores": {"negative": 0.161, "neutral": 0.7435, "positive": 0.0955}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o2ur4yp", "post_id": "1qi6x9i", "subreddit": "overemployed", "body": "Sounds like you could use something that helps you plan what you can safely spend each month if one of your jobs goes bust", "author": "Outside-Evidence551", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1769892620.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.4827233552932739, "compound_score": -0.3662, "scores": {"negative": 0.4417, "neutral": 0.4827, "positive": 0.0755}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o0rwbdr", "post_id": "1qijuuz", "subreddit": "overemployed", "body": "**Join the Official FREE /r/Overemployed Discord Server!**\n\n- Voice your opinions about the server.\n- Connect with like-minded individuals.\n- Learn about Overemployment (OE) strategies and tips from **experienced experts** in the community.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Due to an unfortunate turn of events, I find myself deep in debt and at a point where I need to pick a second job just to avoid losing everything. I have a side hustle, but it's commission based and not nearly steady enough to help with current situation. So I needed a job that will ensure a steady pay, hence, I got a second full time job which will help with this. The issues I face are:\n\n  \n1. Both are hybrid and requires 40hr work week. My current job (Company A) is 3x/week in office. The new job (Company B) will be once a week (I think I can manage this - maybe cos my current job is a bit flexible in the sense that I can mostly choose the days I work in office - unless there is a meeting)  \n2. The main issue I have is that my current company's (Company A) pension, RRSP, etc is managed by Company B which I will be joining soon. I'm worried that when I join company B and they create a pension or RRSP account for me, they will see my existing profile and that will lead to problems I certainly don't want to have right now.  \n  \nI'm not sure what to do and I really need this job, but I risk impacting or even losing my current job if I proceed with the new job.

You got scared because the only way she found your old job and colleagues is from linkedin. So you deactivated it. You heard that they had to call the cops on her because she started throwing stuff while yelling \" I know he works here! I just want to talk to him\" but she left before they got to arrest her. Her name is Karen and the reason you two broke up was cause she started to use drugs and one day you woke up and she had a knife in her hand. So u darted out and decided u could not help her anymore. But she always seems to pop up every 6 months. And you broke up with her 2 years ago. And dont understand why she keeps look for you. You can't put a restraining order because u dont even know where she lives. So for privacy sake it is just better this way. And then do a 1000 mile stare to sell it. Shake it off and say \" Yeah.. I dont want to talk about my personal life anymore, but now u know.\" And if they offer suggestions say \" Thanks I will consider that. But i feel safer my way for now. Anyways, I had to ask u about something.\" And then redirect them to a question they have to think about. Ask about the insurance and when u will be allowed to join and if they know how much it is. That u are thinking about getting some check ups etc. They won't have the answer but will now be distracted with a task. \n\nGOOD LUCK.", "author": "NessaMonsta17", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1770667063.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.7315438985824585, "compound_score": -0.1725, "scores": {"negative": 0.2205, "neutral": 0.7315, "positive": 0.048}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4i56q3", "post_id": "1qzutuf", "subreddit": "overemployed", "body": "Ok, delete the recruiter and update your current don't make any changes to your linkedin referencing your current employers.

They have been laying off for the last two years, really heavy last year. Then this year they announced they were laying off monthly for the first two quarters of 2026. The stress was insane but it was eased a bit by the fact that I have J2 and J3.  J2 is laying off Tuesday but so may be down to one J soon but I’ll dry my tears in the Caribbean next week, come back and get back at it.

Jobs with a light or moderate workload, never heavy.\n\n2. Finish onboarding before looking for another job.\n\n3. Have financial goals, this is very motivating.\n\n4. Keep your laptops muted, so if you join a meeting you don't risk Teams popping out with a company that doesn't use Teams.\n\n5. Don't tell anyone you're doing OE. (Except your spouse)\n\n6. Overlapping will happen, it's up to you to decide whether to prioritize one or risk doing both (or three) at the same time.\n\n7. Have a clear weekly planner, with it I schedule and set my daily goals, I can see the whole week and stay organized.\n\n8. Don't increase your quality of life with the new salaries, the J1 salary has to be enough for you.\n\n9. Don't draw too much attention to yourself; don't be the one who solves everything. Be the one who does what was agreed upon.\n\n10. Have separate laptops for each job.\n\n11. Avoid management positions; they involve many meetings, and usually important ones.\n\n12. Keep stacking up work until you find your sweet spot. In my case, it was 3. (But follow rule number 2).\n\n13.
