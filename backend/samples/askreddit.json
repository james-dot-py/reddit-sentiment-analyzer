If you are still nervous/thinking you aren't going to like it, then they make flavored lubes that you can use for oral. When I was learning to like giving bjs, that was very helpful. It's mostly a mental thing because if he's clean then his dick should just taste like skin. But with the lube he tastes like vanilla cookies. Yum!\n2. Be enthusiastic, and enjoy the way you are making your guy feel. Ask him to be vocal and tell you how hot you are. I'm really into praise, so a \"good girl\" goes a long way for me 🥵Tell him what you want- hold my hair back, don't push me down, grab both sides of my head and make me your sex doll- WHATEVER you feel like. Some days I'm into a slow and sensual bj and some days I just want to be used. Both are good.\n3. MOST IMPORTANTLY- if you aren't having fun, then you are doing it wrong! I usually use a bullet vibrator on myself while giving him a bj. This way I get to feel good while he feels good. I've cum while he was deep in my mouth, which made him cum right away. This has become basically a Pavlovian response now because even if I don't use a vibrator, I find myself sooo horny. \n\nThe last thing I should mention is that I found out a grind/clench my teeth in my sleep, so now I wear a night guard.
