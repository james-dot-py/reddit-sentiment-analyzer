Samsung refused warranty because of tiny cosmetic scuffs on the frame — even though the fault is a known hardware defect affecting thousands of users. They’re still selling these extremely expensive “premium” devices while refusing to honour warranty obligations for a widespread issue.\n\nWhat happened\n\nMy Fold 6 suddenly developed a green vertical line and the inner screen stopped responding to touch. No drops, no impact, no misuse. Just normal use.\n\nThis is the well‑known pixel‑driver/column‑driver IC failure that has affected multiple generations of the Fold series.\n\nSamsung’s repair centre refused warranty because of minor cosmetic scuffs on the frame — marks that have absolutely nothing to do with an internal OLED failure. They quoted me \\~£500 for the repair.\n\nI’ve owned multiple Samsung phones, a Samsung laptop, tablet, watch, earbuds… and this is how they treat loyal customers.\n\nWhy this is unacceptable\n\nThe cosmetic scuffs have no causal link to:\n\n* OLED pixel‑driver failure\n* Green/pink line defects\n* Digitizer failure\n* Crease‑area stress failures\n\nThis is a manufacturing defect, not user damage.  \nYet Samsung uses cosmetic marks as a loophole to deny warranty repairs.\n\nThis isn’t an isolated case — it’s widespread\n\nReports of the same failure are everywhere:\n\n* Samsung Community forums (UK/EU/US)\n* Reddit (r/GalaxyFold, r/Samsung, r/Android)\n* XDA Developers\n* YouTube repair channels\n* Carrier repair centres (Vodafone, EE, Three, AT&T, T‑Mobile)\n\nPeople are reporting:\n\n* Failures after 6–9 months\n* Warranty refusals due to tiny scuffs\n* Repeat failures even after repair\n* Fold 7 already showing early cases of the same issue\n\nSamsung has not redesigned the panel. Replacement screens use the same weak column‑driver IC placement, so the issue can recur.\n\n**The bigger problem**: Samsung is still selling these devices\n\nWhat makes this worse is that Samsung continues to sell the Fold series — including the latest refresh — despite years of identical inner‑screen failures.\n\nThey market these devices as “premium” and charge £1,700+, but when the inevitable failure happens, they routinely refuse warranty repairs by pointing to irrelevant cosmetic marks.\n\nIt feels like they’re knowingly selling a fragile, fault‑prone product and then using technicalities to avoid honouring their warranty obligations. Many customers are being left with a very expensive brick and a £500+ repair bill.\n\nWhat I’ve done\n\nI sent Samsung a formal complaint stating:\n\n* Cosmetic marks are not causally related to the defect\n* The issue is a known hardware failure\n* I want escalation to a senior agent\n* If not resolved, I will request a deadlock letter and take it to ADR (Ombudsman Services)\n\nADR is free for consumers and legally binding for the company.\n\nMy instinct is to sell the device (if I can even get it repaired under warranty) and never purchase from Samsung again, at least not without a reasonable elapsed stability period, then assessing known hardware faults online after that. \n\nAs per page 2...  \n[Galaxy Z Fold 6 Inner Screen Fault - Page 2 - Samsung Community](https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-z-fold-z-flip/galaxy-z-fold-6-inner-screen-fault/td-p/11813032/page/2)", "author": "MartynAndJasper", "score": 65, "num_comments": 131, "created_utc": 1770384616.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qxhnzz/samsung_fold_buyer_beware/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1qxhnzz/samsung_fold_buyer_beware/"}, {"id": "1qp97zg", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Samsung Galaxy A37 and Galaxy A57's official renders surface", "selftext": "", "author": "mo_leahq", "score": 60, "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1769600921.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qp97zg/samsung_galaxy_a37_and_galaxy_a57s_official/", "url": "https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a37_galaxy_a57_design_renders-news-71282.php"}, {"id": "1qiy4fa", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Evleaks says Galaxy S26 Ultra will get more than four color options", "selftext": "", "author": "mo_leahq", "score": 63, "num_comments": 33, "created_utc": 1769002730.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qiy4fa/evleaks_says_galaxy_s26_ultra_will_get_more_than/", "url": "https://www.gsmarena.com/new_rumor_says_galaxy_s26_ultra_will_debut_in_more_than_four_color_options-news-71186.php"}, {"id": "1qf7s3i", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "GSMArena - Oppo Reno15 Pro (mini) review", "selftext": "", "author": "Antonis_32", "score": 62, "num_comments": 26, "created_utc": 1768637934.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qf7s3i/gsmarena_oppo_reno15_pro_mini_review/", "url": "https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_reno15_pro_mini-review-2920.php"}, {"id": "1qqpe9m", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Galaxy S26 lineup design revealed via leaked magnetic case renders", "selftext": "", "author": "mo_leahq", "score": 58, "num_comments": 44, "created_utc": 1769730958.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qqpe9m/galaxy_s26_lineup_design_revealed_via_leaked/", "url": "https://www.gsmarena.com/galaxy_s26_lineup_design_revealed_via_leaked_magnetic_case_renders-news-71309.php"}, {"id": "1qo6noe", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "OnePlus 15R review: The competition, our verdict, pros and cons", "selftext": "", "author": "Antonis_32", "score": 60, "num_comments": 20, "created_utc": 1769496900.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qo6noe/oneplus_15r_review_the_competition_our_verdict/", "url": "https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_15r-review-2923p6.php"}, {"id": "1qjpi17", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "[Dev] I built RendrFlow: A privacy first, 100% offline AI Upscaler that runs entirely on-device (No cloud uploads)", "selftext": "Hi r/Android,\n\nI am the developer of RendrFlow.\n\nI built this app because I was tired of \"free\" upscalers that force you to upload your personal photos to a cloud server or hit you with a paywall after 3 edits.

She loves solitaire and crosswords and uses a tablet for this I occasionally upgrade, right now it is a cheap Headwolf thing running Android 15.\n\nA problem with the solitaire games is there does not seem to be one you can just buy and nix the ads -- they all go for an in app ad model, and one which seems to have ultimately malicious (albeit probably pointless so) consequences.  The ads take full screen, frenetic and agitating, and make it hard to discern how to dismiss them. \n\nAs if that were not mean spirited enough, when mom does whatever to try and dismiss them, I think they go through a quick sequence which ends in them installing other things via the Play Store, and these things then exploit whatever permissions to continue running more and more frequent and intrusive ads.  When it finally becomes so dysfunctional that I need to go through the app list and delete LITERALLY DOZENS AND DOZENS *AND DOZENS* of different PDF viewers (WTF?) and solitaire games, the tablet is almost unusable -- the full screen pop-ups start at reboot, constantly re-orient the screen back and forth, and seem able to interrupt everything. However, once all or most of the PDF viewers and solitaire apps are gone, the ads stop.\n\nNo point in complaining that google has created an OS which makes this possible, of course, since much of the action goes through the Play Store I imagine there are pennies in there for them somehow. \n\nAbout a month ago I finally got sick of doing the app removal and factory reset the tablet, since most of her stuff could be restored from her phone (which she uses for crosswords, not solitaire).  Now here I am a month later doing the same thing again, and the ad action is SO AGGRESSIVE that after a reboot it still took THREE OR FOUR MINUTES just to get into Settings and find the reset because every 2-3 seconds (or less) I was interrupted by a FULL SCREEN AD.  While I was in Settings. Half of them require a timeout, and AFAICT, actually get interrupted by further ads.  Like some kind of dark comic sci-fi nightmare. That's immediately after a reboot.\n\nWhat I'm looking for here is NOT better solitaire game recommendations.  There are a few minimal ad free ones which she just won't take to, and I do not think there is a real solution otherwise.  They all end up running ads for other solitaire games (presumably, via Play Store algorithm) with nefarious, hard to avoid install schemes that include all these ridiculous PDF viewer apps, most of which I think actually don't work much (or at all) and simply function to engage the notification system such that they can keep bombing the interface with more full screen pop ads that do more of the same thing until nothing really works.  Completely bonkers.\n\nI'm actually an android fan and former software developer, and part of me wants to believe this could just be some sort of zaniness enabled by Headwolf, but ultimately I don't.  Google could put a stop to this, and since they haven't yet, they probably won't anytime soon.  I understand that it is some cabal of developers exploiting the way the ad algos and play store work, but it still should not be possible.

At this price tier, performance degradation of this magnitude; within roughly **1.5–2 years;** is difficult to justify.\n\nI’m posting this to understand whether others have experienced similar issues and whether this is an isolated case or a broader concern with recent Samsung flagship devices and yes i am shifting to another brand this time permanently.", "author": "WizzieL", "score": 59, "num_comments": 49, "created_utc": 1770458274.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qy9yv6/concern_about_longevity_and_reliability_of/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1qy9yv6/concern_about_longevity_and_reliability_of/"}, {"id": "1qonm1b", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Samsung's Prospects of Winning Qualcomm's 2nm Orders are Reportedly Increasing", "selftext": "", "author": "snowfordessert", "score": 61, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1769541591.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qonm1b/samsungs_prospects_of_winning_qualcomms_2nm/", "url": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/2026/01/samsungs-prospects-of-winning-qualcomms-2nm-orders-are-reportedly-increasing.html"}, {"id": "1r3uvih", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Samsung’s secret ‘Wide’ Galaxy Z Fold foldable shows up in its own software [New Z Fold Leak]", "selftext": "", "author": "TechGuru4Life", "score": 57, "num_comments": 12, "created_utc": 1771002583.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1r3uvih/samsungs_secret_wide_galaxy_z_fold_foldable_shows/", "url": "https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-wide-z-fold-in-one-ui-9-test-build-3640781/"}, {"id": "1qrwso1", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Tired of scam calls?

SurfaceFlinger dump\n\nadb shell dumpsys SurfaceFlinger --display | grep vrrConfig\n\nOn Realme GT 7:\n\nvrrConfig=N/A\n\n👉 Means the phone does not expose VRR to Android’s new Adaptive Refresh Rate (ARR) API (introduced in Android 15).\nOn Samsung devices (like S24), you’d see actual values (min/max intervals).\n\n\n---\n\n2. HAL check\n\nadb shell dumpsys activity service android.hardware.graphics.composer3.IComposer/default\n\nOn Realme GT 7:\n\nNo services match: android.hardware.graphics.composer3.IComposer/default\n\n👉 Confirms the device is still using HWC2 + proprietary ComposerExt hacks, instead of the new composer3 v3.x HAL that Android 15 requires for proper ARR.\nSamsung uses composer3, which is why their LTPO works fully down to 1 Hz regardless of brightness.\n\n\n---\n\n3.

So the hardware and drivers are fine.\nThe limitation is purely in Realme’s software policy: they artificially disable VRR below 30% brightness.\n\n\n---\n\n⚡ TL;DR\n\nHardware: fully capable (true LTPO panel).\n\nKernel driver: exposes full VRR range.\n\nHAL/software: stuck on HWC2 + vendor hacks → no native Android 15 ARR API support.\n\nResult: Refresh rate only adapts above 30% brightness on Realme/Oppo/OnePlus devices.\n\n\nThis isn’t a hardware limitation. It’s BBK brands shipping outdated display stacks instead of implementing Google’s official ARR API.\n\n\n---\n\nWhy this matters\n\nSamsung users get proper adaptive refresh everywhere.\n\nBBK users (Realme, Oppo, OnePlus) are crippled by software decisions, even though the hardware is the same class.\n\nUnless BBK upgrades to composer3 v3.x in a future update (unlikely for current models), this won’t be fixed.\n\n\n\n---\n\n👉 If you’re annoyed by this, push Realme/Oppo/OnePlus on their forums and socials. The hardware can do it, the kernel can do it, but the software stack is holding us back.", "author": "Standard_Cry_1027", "score": 38, "num_comments": 27, "created_utc": 1769910956.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qsl8tc/discussion_realme_oppo_oneplus_ltpo_panels/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1qsl8tc/discussion_realme_oppo_oneplus_ltpo_panels/"}, {"id": "1r0i2o5", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Huge battery and sleek design: Is that still enough against Xiaomi and rivals? – Motorola Moto G57 Power review", "selftext": "", "author": "BcuzRacecar", "score": 35, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1770674488.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1r0i2o5/huge_battery_and_sleek_design_is_that_still/", "url": "https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huge-battery-and-sleek-design-Is-that-still-enough-against-Xiaomi-and-rivals-Motorola-Moto-G57-Power-review.1221966.0.html"}, {"id": "1r3qsy7", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Android 1.6 system dump", "selftext": "", "author": "sg_squad", "score": 35, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1770993416.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1r3qsy7/android_16_system_dump/", "url": "https://archive.org/details/android-1.6-system-dump"}, {"id": "1qr8p7w", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Exclusive: Samsung Galaxy S26 & Galaxy S26+ Renders & Specs", "selftext": "", "author": "FragmentedChicken", "score": 39, "num_comments": 25, "created_utc": 1769787265.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qr8p7w/exclusive_samsung_galaxy_s26_galaxy_s26_renders/", "url": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26"}, {"id": "1qqcs3w", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Redmi Turbo 5 Max goes official with 9,000mAh battery, Dimensity 9500s SoC", "selftext": "", "author": "mo_leahq", "score": 37, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1769703027.0, "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1qqcs3w/redmi_turbo_5_max_goes_official_with_9000mah/", "url": "https://www.gsmarena.com/redmi_turbo_5_max_goes_official_with_9000mah_battery_dimensity_9500s_soc-news-71318.php"}, {"id": "1qoagyz", "subreddit": "Android", "title": "Afraid of price hike in 2026 should I buy now?", "selftext": "Hi all, I'm curious about you opinion.

This will use existing Discord data they already have on you.\n\n> However, some users may not have to go through either form of age verification. Discord is also rolling out an age inference model that analyzes metadata like the types of games a user plays, their activity on Discord, and behavioral signals like signs of working hours or the amount of time they spend on Discord.\n\n> “If we have a high confidence that they are an adult, they will not have to go through the other age verification flows,” Badalich says.\n\n> “A majority of people are not going to see a change in their experience.”\n\nI imagine most existing users (especially those with long standing accounts) will fall under this umbrella, but the author has hidden this in the latter half of the article for some reason.\n\nThey're also changing the default setting to one aimed at teenagers. This doesn't require any age verification and most innocuous content will still be broadly available. It will just baby you around a bit more for inappropriate content, unknown friend requests, new messages from unknown people, etc.\n\n> Discord announced on Monday that it’s rolling out age verification on its platform globally starting next month, when it will automatically set all users’ accounts to a “teen-appropriate” experience unless they demonstrate that they’re adults.\n\n> Users who aren’t verified as adults will not be able to access age-restricted servers and channels, won’t be able to speak in Discord’s livestream-like “stage” channels, and will see content filters for any content Discord detects as graphic or sensitive. They will also get warning prompts for friend requests from potentially unfamiliar users, and DMs from unfamiliar users will be automatically filtered into a separate inbox.\n\n> Direct messages and servers that are not age-restricted will continue to function normally, but users won’t be able to send messages or view content in an age-restricted server until they complete the age check process, even if it’s a server they were part of before age verification rolled out. Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, said in an interview with The Verge that those servers will be “obfuscated” with a black screen until the user verifies they’re an adult. Users also won’t be able to join any new age-restricted servers without verifying their age.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't expect any change for existing users who have had their accounts for some time, but longer term, there may be a noticeable slowdown in new user traffic in adult themed communities, since a lot of adults won't want to age verify and will just skip joining.\n\nMore broadly, I am expecting an IRL backlash against social democratic and other similar centre left political parties as these changes bite. It will start to affect the average, low information voter who is usually politically apathetic and may not even vote most of the time.\n\nIf these politicians underestimate the backlash against government overreach, then they may find themselves handing easy victories to their centre right opponents who are in favour of smaller government, more liberty/freedom and less unnecessary government regulation such as this.", "author": "nobelharvards", "score": 41, "created_utc": 1770656128.0}, {"id": "o4gxeme", "post_id": "1r087kc", "subreddit": "Android", "body": "> I feel like a significant chunk of people are only reading the headline.\n\nthe greatest irony of the name reddit is that no one actually read it", "author": "Reptile00Seven", "score": 36, "created_utc": 1770659704.0}, {"id": "o4gppi8", "post_id": "1r087kc", "subreddit": "Android", "body": "A reminder that IRC still exists and you can create your own channels and it's easy to set up your own server to have a private IRC network.", "author": "Ciderbat", "score": 11, "created_utc": 1770657496.0}, {"id": "o4h2zwc", "post_id": "1r087kc", "subreddit": "Android", "body": "Wait till Reddit inevitably requires this.", "author": "blueblocker2000", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1770661272.0}, {"id": "o4hobb7", "post_id": "1r087kc", "subreddit": "Android", "body": "Then it will die.

We want to share a clear update directly with the Nova community.\n\nInstabridge has acquired Nova Launcher. We are a Swedish company building products that help people get online, used by millions of people worldwide.\n\n**What this means right now**\n\nNova is not shutting down. Our immediate focus is simple: keep Nova stable, compatible with modern Android, and actively maintained.\n\nWe also know many of you have lived through a long period of uncertainty. Nova has a strong identity and a community that still cares deeply. We take that seriously.\n\n**How we will approach stewardship**\n\nOur job is not to reinvent Nova overnight. Our job is to be responsible owners.\n\nThat means:\n\n* Keeping performance and customization at the core\n* Fixing bugs and keeping pace with Android changes\n* Listening carefully before making big product decisions\n* We will be reading and collecting feedback from Reddit, Play Store reviews, email, and other community channels. We will not be able to respond to every post, but we will be paying attention. For support related issues, we will share a clear contact channel shortly.\n\n#FAQ\n\n**Why acquire Nova Launcher?**\n\nWe have long admired what Nova represents: speed, customization, and user control. When we saw how much the community still cares, it was clear to us that Nova deserved a stable future with active maintenance.\n\n**Will Nova still feel like Nova?**\n\nYes. Nova’s identity is the point. Performance, flexibility, and user control stay at the center of the product. Any future changes will be evaluated through that lens.\n\n**Are you going to add ads?**\n\nNova needs a sustainable business model to support ongoing development and maintenance. We are exploring different options, including paid tiers and other approaches. As many of you have already anticipated, we are also evaluating ad based options for the free version.\n\nIf ads are introduced, Nova Prime will remain ad free. Our guiding principles are clear: keep the experience clean and fast, avoid disruptive formats, and provide a straightforward way to keep the experience ad free.\n\n**Is the goal just to keep Nova alive?**\n\nNo. Sustainability is not just about survival. A healthy business model allows us to invest properly in Nova over time.\n\nThat investment enables deeper work on performance, more powerful customization, better long term compatibility with Android, and thoughtful features that require real engineering effort. Our ambition is for Nova to remain a launcher that power users choose because it continues to do things exceptionally well and evolves with the platform.\n\nWe will move deliberately and prioritize quality over rushing features out the door.\n\n**What about existing Nova Prime users?**\n\nWe respect everyone who has supported Nova over the years. We intend to honor existing Prime purchases, and Prime features will continue working for existing Prime users. Nova Prime will also remain ad free.\n\n**What about the price of Nova Prime?**\n\nSome of you noticed that the price of Nova Prime increased shortly before the app was transferred to our account. We have now changed it to 3.99 USD, effective immediately, and we apologize for the timing and the confusion it caused.\n\nAs we explore a sustainable long term model, we may evaluate other pricing options or tiers. If we do, we will aim to keep it fair and communicate clearly ahead of time.\n\n**Will Nova become open source?**\n\nWe know this matters to many of you. It is something we are actively evaluating. Open sourcing a product responsibly involves licensing, security, build tooling, contribution workflow, and trademark stewardship. We do not have a decision to share yet, but we will be transparent once we do.\n\n**What about privacy?**\n\nWe will keep data collection minimal and purpose driven, and we will be clear about what is collected and why. We do not sell personal data.\n\n#Closing\n\nWe are here for the long term. Trust is earned through consistent maintenance and clear communication, not big promises.

Just like he did with Brother.\n\nThere is a rollback mechanism, just not to vulnerable pre-.501 builds. Since this is the first post-fix update, it is currently the only rollback target. Over time, as OnePlus releases additional updates, you will be able to roll back among multiple secure versions. What they will not be able to do is roll back to builds that predate the security fix.\n\nThis is the correct decision from OnePlus. Prior to this update, a stolen device could be wiped using leaked EDL tools and reflashed with clean firmware, allowing it to be resold as a fully functional phone rather than parted out. The lack of effective EDL restrictions made device theft more viable.\n\nThe current update closes that loophole. Preventing rollbacks to known vulnerable builds is a necessary security measure, not an anti-consumer one. All other Android OEMS have this.\n\nNot to mention that it was already stated in the original post that OnePlus replaces motherboards on devices bricked by ARB without any problem.\n\nEDIT: [Here ](https://xdaforums.com/t/may-2025-and-newer-beware-of-permanent-bricks-if-you-dont-handle-the-anti-rollback-bootloader-correctly-on-all-pixel-6-6-pro-6a-8-8-pro-8a.4735780/)is a thread for Pixel devices from May 2025 getting bricked by ARB.

(13, 13T, Find X8U, OnePlus Pad 2 Pro) This update triggers ARB protection in the AVB implementation, the reason being older versions of AVB on those firmwares contained a EDL signature leaked to the Chimera tool and Cellebrite, which could enable extraction of data from devices without the owner even knowing. However, OnePlus did this in a very rushed way which led to the mass bricking. This can currently be avoided on unlocked phones by substituting the new ARB-related images with older versions.(abl.img、xbl.img、xbl\\_config.img、xbl\\_ramdump.img). Custom ROM developers/maintainers will need to update their package to keep working. Allegedly OnePlus is working on new downgrade packages for the affected devices to prevent the bricking from happening, and changing how ARB works on other devices so custom ROMs or any other flashing with unlocked bootloader will not cause a brick.

This includes looking at the headers of eMail that most of the time one never looks at.  If there is a match here bang - that can trigger an action such as kick to spam.  \n\nSome moths ago I use a nifty eMail client called Eudora.  This was the only client I have seen that had a 99.9% ability to select the proper sorting method.  I have used many different client as tech-support and as a user in need of equivalent replacement.  Betterbird is my current flavor of choice today, it seem to have good of sharing my filters to my current mail server provider.

Make the entire phone as thick as the camera bump.\n2. Switch back to 1/4\" or smaller image sensors that can be thinner, but come with a huge loss in image quality\n3. Implement some sort of telescoping lens mechanism that retracts the camera lens into the phone when not in use.\n4. Invent a completely new way to capture images that doesn't involve a single lens focusing light onto a single image sensor\n\n4 is probably the most likely thing that will come along one day. A lot of work has been done on multi-camera arrays combining into a single image, especially in Astronomy. One day I could see something like an array of 9 cameras with 1/4\" sensors on the back of a phone being used to make one high quality image that could be thin, Nokia had a phone that tried to do this 5 or 6 years ago but the tech wasn't ready yet.
