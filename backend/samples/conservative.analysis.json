They go further to say that if you didnt vote Kamala, you are also responsible for his death.  They then go even further to say that even if you did vote for Kamala but you still have relations or are civil with someone who didnt, you are a nazi.  \n\nThey are saying that anyone who didnt vote for Kamala is a nazi and responsible for Alex Pretti's death, and if people dont disassociate with anyone conservative then they are also nazis because \"if you sit at a table with 10 nazis, then there are 11 nazis.\" \n\nDo you see this tactic?  The first step is to establish that their opposition are nazis, less than human, then they guilt their own side into cutting off loved ones for differing political views or be called nazis themselves.  They are forcing each other to \"pick a side\" and any side that doesn't do exactly what they say, are nazis.  \n\nSounds to me like they themselves are the nazis here. ",

Before I make a judgment, I need to see the original source material. Has anyone been able to find the video specifically about voting fraud? I certainly don’t know one way or the other, but if there are any form of credits or even a slow/boring outro where they start to plug their other crap I know I always quit the video or move onto the next, etc. \n\nThese are largely just off of the top of your head type thoughts but my main question or concern is finding the original video regardless",

        "body": "Carte blanche” makes it sound like permission equals control, but that isn’t how military operations actually work. Countries stay safe not by assuming the best, but by preparing for what could go wrong. Greenland matters today because it sits under the shortest routes for long-range missiles and aircraft, and it affects how quickly threats can be detected and understood in the Arctic. In that part of the world, minutes matter. Satellites help, but they do not replace permanent radar, communications, and monitoring on the ground.\n\nAlliances are vital, and cooperation with allies is a strength. Still, prudence asks whether reliance on permission and coordination will always hold in a fast-moving crisis. This concern did not begin with the current debate or with any one president. The geography has been the same for decades and has been a defense priority across multiple administrations long before Trump. People can rightly object to tariffs or heavy-handed tactics and still accept that the underlying security question is serious and deserves to be faced plainly.",

ICE fills this roll. Protestors interfering with the official duties of federal agents is not helping the situation. Violent rhetoric, from either side, is not helping the situation.\n\nHowever, yesterday was a display of poorly trained agents conducting their duties recklessly. The protestor was disarmed and detained. After that, he was shot in the street. I cannot justify that.\n\nThe responsible parties need to be held to account.",

There is absolutely nothing new going on what so ever.  The only difference between two generations ago and today is that so many people got stinking rich from the excessive bloat of an oversized government...  (can you guess)  The only difference is that as the word has spread how easy it is to defraud government systems, more people are demanding to be cut in on the action.\n\nSo now they're blaming lack of oversight and controls, poor training.  This is the same game they play for every major governmental institution.  The entirety of all of them are rife with waste fraud and abuse.  There is no exception.  \n\nYou're just caught up in the political moment.  Nothing has really changed.   And you'll know nothing is going to change, as long as the people continue to vote for more and larger government, your taxes always goes up, the volume of rules increases rather than decreases.   Etc, etc.   That's how you know it's really actually extra ordinarily easy to identify what's happening here.\n\nYou know what you can count on;  Nobody will actually go to jail.  The excessive taxation will never stop.\n\nSo for all the people thinking they're so current and on top of the political informational ladder I've got news for you;  The entire system is corrupt and the fraud runs all directions.  People say the government is so bipartisan and can not agree.  You know that's actually not true.  They agree on one core principal which keeps the government working full time, so there is always a seat for these people at the table.  The power may switch hands but nothing every actually changes.   Because;  They always agree on taxing you more, and spending more of your tax dollars.  They take turns and are reasonably fair, doling it to one side, then the other, then the other again.   Everyone whom knows anyone in these halls of power gets their chance at special contracts, high earnings, promotions, and posh situations.  It's a wealth give away of truly epic proportions.\n\nAnd you and I get to pay for it forever and nothing will ever change as long as people stay glued to the propaganda box.  \n\nYou are watching political theater.  Enjoy the show.   It's custom tailored just for you.",

I did a quick google on that.\n\nConservatives support MJ and general de prohibition too you know.\n\nSuch policies redirect hundreds of millions of otherwise black market sales that have happened and will continue to happen, redirecting that to the light and is commonly used to fund entire projects, schools, etc.  The primary benefit I'd personally think is the legalization if applied universally will have notable effects on gang and organized crime activity, as it's one of their primary sources of income.\n\nThe more prohibition we deal with, the more organized crime follows.   Otherwise we'd have much less potent drugs, far fewer addiction and death issues.   We could have skipped the entire fentanol crisis by simply allowing codeine (a weak opioid) into cough syrup.   We never had all these problems, not at the levels we see today, until prohibition became a widespread narrative.  Otherwise people would drink milk of the poppy, sleep it off, and despite what it did to their behavior and addictive qualities, they would not be bothering anyone else other than hurting themselves.  And sometimes actually healing themselves.   Like maybe less autistic kids who's mothers took too much tylenol?  Fewer people with reduced IQ's?  It's the prohibition that creates the need for higher potency for smuggling and black market sale purposes, which then in turn creates far more of a hazard than the simple form of the drug itself presented in the first place.  Prohibition makes the abuse and addiction far far worse, the stricter it is levied, the worse things get.  We may not want or benefit from full on total legalization but I think it's safe to say zero tolerance never worked in the first place.  Give me a break with marijuana staying on schedule one.  They're out there curing cancer and all manner of conditions but as Henry Rollins educated us on the hundred things you did not know series, we can't test MJ for medical, because the only people approved to test this is the federal government who's primary and controlling client is the drug enforcement arm people.  It's a loop, a catch 22.  A completely disingenuous approach.   At best, MJ should reside on schedule 3 or not at all.  Half the hallucinogens should be downgraded as well.  \n\nThe hardline position against MJ should end.  It was never appropriately deserved in the first place.  Free up law enforcement to pursue real criminals not pot smokers.",

Writing his future wife, Coretta Scott, during the first summer of their relationship, he told her that he was “more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic”\n\nI agree with King on some issues, but he was also a pro communism pro socialism of capitalism.

In a July 2013 email draft from Epstein (which may or may not have been sent), he claimed Gates asked one of his advisers for antibiotics to treat a sexually transmitted disease resulting from “sex with Russian girls.” \n\nEpstein allegedly suggested slipping the medication to Melinda Gates without her knowledge, framing it as part of his role in facilitating Gates’ “illicit trysts with married women.” The files also mention Epstein providing Adderall for Gates’ bridge tournaments. This has sparked widespread discussion online, with users speculating it explains aspects of Gates’ divorce or his Epstein ties.\n\nMelinda French Gates has cited the Epstein association as a factor in their split, though she’s focused on her own philanthropy since.",

Sure there were big cities, but there were also growing industries that were not in cities.  \n\nThese growing industries were 20 to 50 miles outside the cities.  New developments were mixed between larger homes (for the owners of industry) and smaller homes for the workers.  \n\nCities grew encompassing the smaller town.  A house I bought in a rural town 50 years ago for $16,000 now sells for $115,000.  Not because house prices went up, but because the city grew, demand is higher.  \n\nThe market force is supply and demand.  Less supply in the city (can only build so much in a space) the higher the demand.  \n\nSo, long story short, find a place 20 or 50 miles outside the city for a more reasonable prices home (with greater investment potential) and wait for the city to grow.  \n\nHopefully, gas prices will stay down, and the idea of electric cars for everyone will take a more reasonable path.    \n\nAnother home, living in now has increased in value by six times.  Outside city, now inside city in 30 years.   \n\nOr you can hope and pray for a housing crash, but that is not very kind to your fellow citizens. Crashed do happen on a pretty regular basis.",

Man, I don't know how I'll be able to justify such an action if true. I keep saying that's it's to get us at NATO to get our shit together and not freeload off the US.

That is a part of it, but who are the beneficiaries of those increases?

They raised prices so we can raise prices too. Perceived supply chain problems caused people to raise prices regardless of whether they actually materialized or not. All of this happened then they just never lowered prices down once things normalized. Businesses consolidated with many of them moving toward higher margins and less volume because logistically it's less expensive and easier just to sell less products at higher margins. Car dealerships moved to this model, no more volume sales are needed when they can make the same money moving less metal, with less on hand inventory.",

They went into effect only about 6 months into his term, and many companies loaded up on goods that have only recently run out before needing to buy at the higher tariffed rate.  The economic inefficiency of tariffs - forcing Americans to produce expensive goods that used to be cheaper and taking those Americans out of the labor pool for more efficient jobs - is only just starting.  \n\nSome industries, like steel producers, might grow, but most, like every industry that uses steel, will suffer.  \n\nFree market economics works.  It's been studied for centuries.  The overall benefits of low/no tariffs are well documented.  And that doesn't even take into account the harm done by reciprocal tariffs in other countries and things like the angry citizens of Canada no longer buying American booze.  \n\nAnyone wanting to understand this better, should check out famed conservative economist Thomas Sowell's *Basic Economics*.

Go argue with 100 years of supreme court rulings. \n\n\nThis guy thought the second amendment existed during the commission of a crime, because some idiot leftist told him it did.\n\n\nActively resisting arrest while armed makes lethal force justifiable even if the firearm is holstered. If they resist arrest, there is no reasonable assumption they won't escalate the resistance to using their firearm.\n\n\nProtesting ICE is fine. \n\n\nIf you want to be armed like reddit tells you to be:\n\n\n1. NEVER interfere with law enforcement. That is a crime and suspends your first and second amendment claims. If arrested, at BEST you are now illegally carrying a firearm while in engaging in criminal activity. \n2. NEVER RESIST ARREST. NOT EVEN MILDLY. NOT EVEN PASSIVELY. You are an armed criminal, and the SCOTUS has ruled that lethal force is justified when someone resisting is found to be armed, regardless of control of the firearm. \n\n\nThe reality is that the Supreme Court in 1989 ruled lethal force justifiable if a reasonable officer in that situation, in the moment believed it was necessary.\n\n\nThe question of another officer disarming him and yelling gun is not fact changing. In a physical altercation, tunnel vision develops and \"mistake of fact\" is a legal defense to hindsight. \n\n\nDo not protest with guns. Reddit allowing \"use your second amendment rights\" comments is why this guy is dead. The left is begging useful idiots to martyr themselves and they are. ",

Oh yeah, and he was fighting back enough against the officers that a healthy group of them was actively having to work to subdue him.\n\nSo yeah, someone calls gun, he continues to fail to comply with force and commands, and he gets shot.\n\nAll of these people who think injecting themselves into these already-chaotic law enforcement situations is going to have any positive benefit are dumb as shit.",

Why not focus on domestic policy (Healthcare, MN riots, energy independence) ? He is trying to do so much at once and it’s great what he has accomplished…but quality over quantity.",

Him being disarmed was not a violation of his rights, as he was committing a crime at the time his firearm was seized, the crime being obstruction. He didn’t deserve to die over it, instead that occurred because of mishandling by the agent who seized the firearm and who was presumably attempting to clear it when a ND happened, leading the other agents to react. Some people say in other videos you can see him reaching for his waistband but I can’t comment because I haven’t seen that actual footage. \n\nGovernment needs to admit the mistake and move on. Even if he wasn’t legally carrying, it has absolutely no bearing on the shooting being justified or not. Bringing a gun to a protest where the carrier is going to knowingly get into physical altercations with federal law enforcement was dumb. Two things can be true. He was dumb and ICE was incompetent. The government grasping at straws somehow trying to justify this shooting is just embarrassing.",

I live in South Carolina where they have similar legislation, but not close enough. In South Carolina, the assessed rate is 4% on your primary property, and 6% on additional properties. I would personally go 1-2% on the primary and have an ascending rate, for example 6% on the second property, 10% on the third property, 15% on the fourth, and 20% on the fifth. This would also save property taxes for the primary owner. Include principal owners/multiple owners/ LLCs as same name in some way to prevent fraud. Obviously you would have to make an exception for multi-family units such as apartments (keep them around the same rate) as you would not want inflation. This is just my two cents on how to do from a local level.",

Of course he doesn't have the power to do that.\n\nMyself I think the best solution to the investor-owned residential property problem is by wielding state/local property taxes.  In most places, residential property is taxed at the same rate whether it's owner-occupied or investor-owned.  You just separate it out so that investor-owned residential property is levied a higher property tax rate, and that will nudge all the investors to sell their inventory to people who will actually live there.",

Banning this tends to raise rents while lowering housing costs-- essentially if you are poor enough that you can't afford to buy a home you lose while if you are wealthy enough and choose to start buying a home you win. \n\n[In Rotterdam, something similar was implemented in 2022, it was a \"buy-to-let\" ban](https://studenttheses.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/20.500.12932/44390/Masterthesis%20-%20Ruben%20Welkers%206594433%20-%20The%20effect%20of%20the%20buy-up%20protection.pdf?sequence=1). The end result was that homes got cheaper by 1% for home purchasers, but for renters there was a 5% increase in rent. Essentially, this law made it so that upper-middle class people in Rotterdamn got a slight discount while the poorer people, people who rented these living spaces, ate shit with a 5% increase.\n\n>From this analysis, it becomes clear that the buy-up protection was able to prevent the average square meter price of housing in buy-up protection neighbourhoods from being € 29,22 (±1%) higher than if the buy-up protection was not implemented. However, this analysis also shows that the buy-up protection was responsible for a € 0,80 (±5%) increase in the average square meter monthly rent in buy-up protection neighbourhoods.\n\nDon't like this.",

On Monday, he refused to rule out military action to take the Arctic territory.\n\nLater, he also posted another screenshot of a text message and said it was from Mr Rutte.\n\nIt read: “Mr. President, dear Donald, what you have achieved today in Syria is incredible. I will use my media engagements in Davos to highlight your work there, in Gaza, and in Ukraine. I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can’t wait to meet you. Yours, Mark.”\n\nBefore releasing the message, Mr Trump stated that he had “a very good phone conversation” with Mr Rutte [on Greenland](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/19/cosmetics-billionaire-trump-bid-buy-greenland/) and agreed to meet “various parties” in Davos, where the WEF is taking place.\n\n**Read more:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2026/01/20/trump-publishes-private-text-messages-european-leaders/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2026/01/20/trump-publishes-private-text-messages-european-leaders/)",

We are nurses because we cannot ignore the vulnerable, the sick, the less fortunate. We are nurses because we nourish the empathy and compassion in our hearts. We are nurses because we know that every patient is someone's loved one. Any medical professional willing to deny care or practice substandard care because someone is \"MAGA\", should leave the profession expeditiously.\n\nEdited to add: because I didn't read that it was his personal business -- he does have the right to refuse service. Don't understand what business a nurse anesthetist really runs without practicing under a physician but to each their own I guess. My sentiment absolutely stands though should he be working somewhere like a hospital, clinic, or any other business where he doesn't get to pick his clientele. Exceptions for rural practices bc if you're the only business around providing a healthcare type service and refusing your rural neighbors -- fuck you.",

Some say Rubio was behind, I don't know. \n\nSo there is some positive action, it's wrong to then eliminate this positive action by torching soft power with Greenland threats and then creating what at could easily be interpreted as a money laundering mechanism and inviting Putin in while calling it \"board of peace\" \n\nThe fundamental problem is that Putin is completly opposed to peace, and completly opposed to the US. A snake doesn't stop being dangerous because you call it peace and ask it some money. \n\nHonestly it's quite possible Putin won't even accept given the internal constraints, but the damage of making the offer alone. If Trump is still under the illusion that Putin is a friend of his someone should make the reality very clear very quickly. \n\nNot being tough on Russia is unpopular between Republican, Indipendents or really anyone in the US, it makes no political and no strategic sense. \n\nHow would people react if Biden invited the leader of Hamas in a pay to be in board called \"board of deradicalization\"?

This is just flat not true.  There was an XF-23 to go along with the XF-22 and an X-32 to go along with the X-35, all four airframes were unveiled to the public before the flyoffs, and the winners of the flyoffs were announced (long) before serial production began.\n\nNeither of the production versions are 35 years old, the F-22's first flight was in 1997 and it entered service in 2005.  The F-35's first flight was the year after that and it finally entered service in 2015.\n\nAre you thinking of, maybe, the F-117 which really ***was*** secret from the beginning and wasn't acknowledged publicly until about half a decade after it entered operational service?",

Over time, that stance hardens into culture and rhetoric. Local officials signal that federal agents are illegitimate or morally suspect. Activist networks form around that premise. Cooperation fades. Hostility becomes normalized.\n\n\n\nIn that environment, every federal enforcement action is treated as provocation rather than law enforcement. Officers are presumed guilty before facts emerge. Resistance is framed as civic virtue. Escalation becomes more likely because enforcement is taking place within a climate deliberately structured to oppose it.\n\n\n\nWhen violence occurs, it is disingenuous to pretend it came from nowhere. Sanctuary policies created a long-standing adversarial posture toward federal authority. What we are seeing now is the predictable result of institutionalized antagonism, not a sudden failure or a single bad encounter. \n\nThat is not resistance to tyranny but the normalization of antagonism toward lawful authority, which undermines the common good and makes violence more likely, not less.",

It seems to me that Trump has this knack for pulling attention away from situations where the left looks artful and placing it squarely on himself.

Every attempt to minimize it just made Walz and Fry look like they were in favor of fraud and abuse. Then, in true Trump fashion, he floods the zone with ICE and all of a sudden the spotlight is on the administration. It ends up being just what the left wants. \n\nI think the answer is to do things in a way that is targeted and by the book, so that dems complaining just reflects badly on them. Make them come out in opposition of popular positions.

The NFL tries so desperately to jump from one popular performer to the next in any hopes of garnering a new audience since covid nuked their watchers.\n\nI honestly can't remember a memorable one since Tom Petty was last there, or cold play.\n\nI try to keep up with modern music but good lord most of it sucks! I still can't believe country of all things too has gotten popular, but in a weird 'pop country' style that rapers and country music stars are all doing now.\n\nSounds like crap on crap to me. Randomly heard The Police on a station I was listening to the other day and was like 'damn, this music is so much better than what we have these days, and I can understand the lyrics too!'",

  "summary_text": "- r/Conservative’s only celebrated topic is **heavily reported** — a moderation label, not a substantive idea, suggesting the community’s most positive interactions involve moderator enforcement\n- **White House** is the most rejected topic at -0.703, indicating the community’s opposition to the current administration\n- **America** itself sits in divisive territory at -0.457 with 70 mentions — the country the community claims to champion generates deeply mixed sentiment\n- The top bigrams are dominated by moderation language: \"thread heavily,\" \"heavily reported,\" \"reported automoderator\" — suggesting heavy content moderation shapes the discussion space\n- Nearly equal negative (47%) and neutral (47.5%) content with only 5.5% positive reveals a community defined by opposition rather than advocacy\n\nThe most revealing finding about r/Conservative isn’t political — it’s structural. The fact that moderation-related phrases dominate the community’s linguistic fingerprint (\"thread heavily,\" \"reported automoderator,\" \"automoderator decided\") tells you this is a heavily curated space where the boundaries of acceptable discourse are actively enforced and discussed.\n\nAt -0.358 mean sentiment, the community runs substantially negative, but the negativity has a specific target. **White House** at -0.703 is the clearest signal of oppositional identity. **Democrats** appears as a frequent entity, confirming the conversation is organized around an adversary rather than around policy positions.\n\n**America** being divisive at -0.457 is the counterintuitive finding. A community that likely considers patriotism a core value produces overwhelmingly negative sentiment when discussing the country itself — suggesting members feel the nation has strayed from their vision of it. **Greenland** and **Minnesota** appearing as top entities point to specific news cycles driving discussion during the analysis period.",
