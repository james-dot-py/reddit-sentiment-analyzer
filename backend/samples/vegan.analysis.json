All this has a huge impact on climate change, although many do not want to talk about it. For me, it is more important than the game itself – it is an approach to life that I am proud of. I hope that my example will inspire other athletes to switch to this regimen, because they can recover well, have strength and muscle.

I recently moved to a small town outside of St Louis. \n\nWith the midterms looming, I wanted to get involved in local politics. I wanted to volunteer with local  groups to try to help educate people on the new local laws around the elections, and help turn out the vote.\n\nI reached out and was added to a group chat in a local Dem group. They have had not one, but TWO events in the past few months that were both STEAK DINNERS. It cost $50 to attend, and there is *NO* other option on the menu, it's literally mashed potatoes, steak, and garlic bread. \n\nI posted in the group saying I wanted to attend, but I'm not sure if they've considered adding a vegan friendly option, or if there's a way to bring my own food and attend at a slightly reduced price (money is tight for me right now, I can't pay $50 for a meal I can't eat). \n\nSeveral people responded saying \"well we can't have a vegetarian dinner! No one would come!\" And of course I clarified that *NO* that's not what I'm asking for, just an option for those who don't want to eat steak. \n\nIn response, nearly half of the people in the group chat left - I am not sure, but I think they may have created a new group chat without me. No one from leadership responded to my request. \n\nThis is, unfortunately, not the first time I've had a similar experience since moving here. \n\nTwo months after arriving, I attended a local women's meet up group pot luck party. I was fully aware that no one else would be vegan, so I brought a huge veggie tray to share and just tried not to mention it to anyone. \n\nWithin the first 15 minutes of my arrival, a woman started badgering me to try the cookies she had brought to share. I said \"that's not in line with my diet right now,\" and she said \"come on, they are small! It's Saturday! Just have one!\" \n\nI debated saying that I have an allergy, but that isn't true, and I didn't want to get caught in a lie with women I was hoping to befriend (if I say I'm allergic to eggs and dairy and meat, etc...). \n\nShe kept badgering me, and literally everyone at the party was watching. Eventually I said I'm vegan. She asked me what that is, and I explained. And then, she literally said, in front of everyone, \"maybe you should go to a meet up for your own kind if you won't eat real food.\" \n\nUnfortunately it's been over two years since then, and I have tried to attend other events or meet local friends in other ways, but it feels impossible - few restaurants here are vegan friendly, so any restaurant meet up is out of the question, and it feels like every event centers around food here. I have gone to a couple of vegan group events in the city (St Louis), but it's a long drive for me, so I can't go often, and the vegan group seems to have their own leadership issues (multiple allegations of SA within the group), so there's that. \n\nI had hoped that the local Democrat party would be more open minded, especially since I am eager to be involved and volunteer my time, but I guess not. \n\nThanks for listening.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how veganism is so often framed as this super risky, fragile thing to partake in whilst an omni diet is treated like the default “safe” option and I hate it, it grates at me so bad. Especially with RFK Jr.’s recent changes to the food pyramid, I think this issue is only going to get worse. It’s very obviously a political agenda meant to normalize this way of thinking:\n\nVegan diets are fragile and risky.\n\nOmni diets are “default safe.”\n\nFor example, nutrient talk is always selectively applied to vegans, it's always iron, B12, protein, calcium, and now apparently iodine… despite the fact that basically everyone, omni or not, is buying iodized salt. Meanwhile, the same scrutiny is rarely applied to omnis, even tho many don’t get enough fiber or antioxidants and consume too much cholesterol and saturated fat, and are DYING due to meat consumption. Meanwhile, you get one vegan in Russia who has an eating disorder and mostly only ate fruit and barely even drank water, and ends up passing due to her disordered eating gets spun as a vegan diet issue. RIP Zhanna Samsonova. She is just one example of a vegan death that gets blamed on the diet, but there are hundreds and even more for omnivorous diets, which are never labeled as “to blame.” This constant framing of veganism with a “carefully planned” disclaimer creates the impression that you must micromanage your diet, or you’ll get sick. I absolutely fell victim to this when I was a new vegan. I internalized it because of all the fear mongering. I supplemented daily, tracked my intake obsessively, and stressed out if I didn’t hit 100% of every marker every single day. I’ve changed since then, but looking back, that wasn’t health consciousness; it was fear. Fear of becoming that trope of the “sick vegan.”\n\nBut in reality, if you’re eating enough calories throughout the day and not just the same damn food over and over, you’re probably getting enough iron. And most of the nutrients people panic about in vegan diets are already present in fortified foods. Not to mention that even if you don’t consume enough of something on a given day, the body regulates nutrient absorption, and deficiencies take time to develop. ANYONE can become deficient and deficiencies are medical issues, not ideological ones, yet they’re constantly framed as ideological when it comes to veganism. And part of this is to blame on our education system, children are not being educated on where nutrients come from and are then easily influenced by media and political crap.\n\nMy biggest gripe has always been iron. Iron is not a “vegan problem.” I believe it's especially an issue for women because of blood loss, which can range from not a lot to excessive, depending on the individual. It can also be caused by inflammation, absorption issues, pregnancy...things that affect all diets.\n\nAnd you know what isn’t scrutinized by the media with the same fear mongering intensity as vegan diets? The fact that heme iron is directly associated with increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Can you imagine how harshly vegans would be criticized if that were associated with plant‑based diets? Not to mention the animal cruelty. Imagine if vegans killed billions of animals for something that gives us cancer 💀\n\nMeanwhile, research has repeatedly shown that plant based diets can prevent, treat, and even reverse some of our leading causes of death. But nope! Vegan diet bad, omni diet “default safe\"!\n\nWhat’s so frustrating with this is how this narrative makes veganism seem anxious, technical, and “other”, something you can do, but only if you’re extremely careful, while omnivory is treated as this effortless and self‑correcting diet, even when evidence shows widespread issues like heart disease, cancer, and, you know, massive animal abuse.\n\nThis framing discourages people before they even begin. And at the end of the day, it’s not just humans who pay the price for this, it's animals that pay the harshest price.\n\nEven in research you'll find this selective alarmism. You never see a disclaimer like “plan your diet carefully or you’ll die of cancer/heart disease” for omnivorous diets, even though that's a very real reality many deal with, but you do get a disclaimer for vegan diets, even though plant-based diets are often shown to be superior. \n\nThese nutrient panic disclaimer you see pretty much everywhere functions socially as a deterrent narrative, even if unintentionally. (But let's be fr, it’s not unintentional. It's social conditioning to keep people cautious and away from veganism.)", "author": "acidic_lighting", "score": 344, "num_comments": 118, "created_utc": 1768600339.0, "permalink": "/r/vegan/comments/1qete82/vegans_always_get_a_be_careful_or_youll_die_talk/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1qete82/vegans_always_get_a_be_careful_or_youll_die_talk/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.8773878812789917, "compound_score": -0.8684, "scores": {"negative": 0.8774, "neutral": 0.1136, "positive": 0.009}}}, {"post": {"id": "1r408n0", "subreddit": "vegan", "title": "Soy on soy", "selftext": "You ever look down on your plate and realise you’re eating soy (sauce) on soy (tofu) with a side of soy (beans) while drinking soy (milk) and for dessert you made soy (protein powder) mixed into soy (yoghurt)?\nOr is that just me?", "author": "WanderingCasually", "score": 334, "num_comments": 48, "created_utc": 1771014614.0, "permalink": "/r/vegan/comments/1r408n0/soy_on_soy/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1r408n0/soy_on_soy/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.8638719916343689, "compound_score": -0.0211, "scores": {"negative": 0.0786, "neutral": 0.8639, "positive": 0.0575}}}, {"post": {"id": "1r2j6gw", "subreddit": "vegan", "title": "I was starved In the psych ward", "selftext": "This was not the first time but it was definitely the worst.

Detergents are among the most widely used chemical products in daily life, and for decades their safety testing relied heavily on animal experiments. By setting a clear legal cutoff in 2029, the EU is signaling that protecting human health and the environment no longer requires animal testing for this category of chemicals.\n\nThis move also hints at a broader shift ahead.

It's my dream to own a non profit like hers and make an impact. But I couldn't be more disgusted by the kind of person she is. I learned about Veganism last year and after knowing the truth of what happens to animals, veganism has been on my mind ever since. It's the only thing I care the most about and it's been on my mind every single day.\n\nWhen I learned that Maya higa wasn't vegan and only went vegan as a \"ha-ha fun challenge!\" it was utterly dissapointing. She literally owns a sanctuary where she takes care of cows and other animals. She knows what happens in these industries. She has far way more knowledge than I have and even from the few reels I've seen, it's a fucking holocaust. No other words to describe it. So why does she own a sanctuary while funding a literal holocaust? Because she doesn't truly love animals.\n\nI've seen so many people passionate about veganism who do activism and speak up the truth for what happens to animals and they make such a big impact in today's world. Maya has such a large platform and she used to do this thing called 'Animal Quest' where she \"teaches\" people about what happens in the Meat and Dairy industries and while she was explaining it, she kept downplaying the severity of what happens to these animals and how people should look out for labels and buy from more \"humane\" companies. \n\nThis is so dishonest as there's no such thing. It's all lies. Even for chickens, \"Free range\" just means having a window while nothing else changes, it's not actually free range. She SHOULD know this, she's been studying this for YEARS. It's baffling she's not vegan, like I just don't understand how. Why am I more passionate about animals compared to the person who made me passionate about animals in the first place. That shouldn't even be possible!!\n\nMaya owns her sanctuary because at heart, she's a pet lover. She likes the interactions with animals upclose, and it's a privillage to be in her position where she's able to be upclose to domestic and wild animals and benefit from happiness. Alveus does amazing things, but I'm seperating the art from the artist here, because it's dishonest to make her as this \"animal lover\" who's doing so much good for the world while she's funding for sentient beings to be killed for her own pleasure. It's psychopathic!! It's like calling billionares who donate to charities for tax reductions as \"good actors\".\n\nPeople like her is what slows down the vegan movement, by lying and telling people that the solution is to \"tone down a bit\" and to \"buy more humane\". It's so rare for someone who's \"passionate\" about animals to accumulate a MASSIVE platform with millions of followers and reach 100's of millions of people yearly (based on alveus annual reports). If she was vegan and honest, can you imagine the impact? This amount of impact would be unseen and make things move at an incredible pace. Which could change everything.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SLeKXrb6io8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SLeKXrb6io8)\n\nShe even made a short recently, talking about \"It's not about a select few of us being 100% better but for millions to be a few percentage points better\". Things like this hurt the movement because you're essentially patting people on the back and taking away from the severeity of it. Once you tell someone \"cut it down just a bit\" nothing much changes and they will eventually forget. People would much rather take the choice of cutting down than to \"sacrifice\" their favorite foods entirely. That's just the truth.  \n  \nImagine if you told a drug addict to cut down on drugs instead of fully quitting. If you continue having it from time to time, it makes it impossible to quit unless you were fully commited from the start and did the research on how. The only impact that \"cutting down\" makes is that maybe 10-20 years from now they will FINALLY go vegan. That's such a horrible approach and does so much harm in the long run. \n\nI'm sorry but you're not vegan if you're telling people that little by little is much better for impact. You wouldn't tell a murderer who gets pleasure from killing others to \"stop killing less people\" you would tell them to fully stop. I'm using an example I haven't seen used yet because it's crazy how when one person dies, it makes news and millions talk about it, but when TENS OF BILLIONS of sentient beings go through 1000x worse in slaughterhouses, people laugh, party, make excuses and call vegans crazy and extremists. We're all senteint beings. You were brainwashed to see animals as objects, wake the fuck up.\n\nI'm not going to make this too long, the reasoning for me typing all this is because I saw a post earlier that someone made on Maya and a lot of people were upset, rightfully so. She's one of the biggest in this space and she's doing more harm than good. We need more people to speak up with the truth and realize that this is the biggest injustice and there's no such thing as being an animal lover while funding for animals to scream in severe pain and agony while they get burned, abused, and slaughtered in the worst ways fucking possible.\n\n  \nCheers to Alveus Sanctuary and Fuck Maya Higa. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "RealCosmicBeast", "score": 204, "num_comments": 168, "created_utc": 1769519591.0, "permalink": "/r/vegan/comments/1qodh8n/maya_higa_the_animal_sanctuary_owner_who_pays_for/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1qodh8n/maya_higa_the_animal_sanctuary_owner_who_pays_for/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.4211433231830597, "compound_score": 0.1332, "scores": {"negative": 0.2228, "neutral": 0.4211, "positive": 0.356}}}, {"post": {"id": "1qx6gbh", "subreddit": "vegan", "title": "Cambridge becomes first Mass. city to endorse Plant Based Treaty — but what does that mean?", "selftext": "", "author": "ProfessionalAd5070", "score": 193, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": 1770347942.0, "permalink": "/r/vegan/comments/1qx6gbh/cambridge_becomes_first_mass_city_to_endorse/", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/environment/2026/01/30/cambridge-becomes-first-mass-city-to-endorse-plant-based-treaty-but-what-does-that-mean/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.9433177709579468, "compound_score": 0.0261, "scores": {"negative": 0.0153, "neutral": 0.9433, "positive": 0.0414}}}, {"post": {"id": "1r1h3gs", "subreddit": "vegan", "title": "Got this message request on Instagram.

I had planned to perhaps publish a book or essay on the subject, but I never have enough time to do so, and besides, books require much more rigour, and therefore I need to spend even more time finding reliable sources.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, I feel like I have to share these ideas or my head is going to explode. So, if you don't mind, I'm going to share a ‘rough draft’ of what's on my mind, with the information I have on the subject. Keep in mind that I MAY have some incorrect information, but in general, most of it should be fine.\n\nI will warn you that English is not my mother tongue, so please excuse me if I make any mistakes.\n\nNow, get ready for a rather long text:\n\n  \n\n\nAs you know, veganism is the ideology that seeks to reduce the unnecessary suffering and death of sentient beings.\n\nTo achieve this, we have focused on reducing our consumption of non-human animal products, and I believe this is correct, as this is the source of most of the suffering and death of non-human animals.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, I believe that we may be being a little negligent in our ideology by not including the greatest cause of suffering (and even death) of human animals (I am calling these people ‘human animals’ because ALL human beings are animals, myself included. It is a way of emphasising that veganism should also have the welfare of these people in mind.): the conditions of slavery or semi-slavery in which many people find themselves.\n\n  \n\n\nI want to clarify that I am not saying that we should return to consuming animal products or that reducing their consumption is less important. I am simply saying that if our ideology is to avoid the unnecessary suffering and death of sentient beings, then the requirements of veganism should include the elimination (or at least reduction) of any product that comes from factories or mines with workers in subhuman conditions.\n\nIn other words, what I'm trying to say is that I believe that if someone wants you to buy a product that you KNOW has a high risk of human slavery, you should be able to say, ‘No, thank you, I'm vegan.’ Even if it doesn't contain animal products, because it comes from the suffering of sentient beings.\n\n  \n\n\nSome people argue that saving animals is a priority because ‘they are suffering more’. I disagree. Human slavery is not simply about your boss treating you badly and making you work hard for little money. I am talking about people who are literally kidnapped and locked up, raped and beaten, forced to work non-stop. The case of semi-slavery is only different in that there is a salary, but it is so low and people have so few alternatives that leaving their “job” would mean death by starvation. In practice, they cannot leave.\n\nIs this really so different from the conditions that animals live in on one of those horrible factory farms?\n\n  \n\n\nI am not seeking to start a debate about who suffers more, but rather to illustrate that this is a situation very bad and totally unacceptable. A person who opposes the unnecessary suffering of sentient beings, that is, a vegan, must, by definition, oppose this.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, it is true that this may be more difficult to achieve. It is easy to know when an animal product contains meat, milk, or eggs. But how can we know under what conditions a T-shirt was made?\n\nFurthermore, it is important to clarify that our goal should not be to eliminate factories in poor countries, as this would leave those people without work. Our goal should be to transform these factories into places where human rights are respected.\n\n  \n\n\nThis means that it is more difficult to decide when a product should be purchased and when it should not. However, on the positive side, it is considered positive by society to fight for human rights, so at least they won't judge us for doing it.\n\n  \n\n\nToday, the average person indirectly has around 60 slaves working for them. Perhaps it is impossible to reach zero in today's world? But we probably can reduce it to 30, and perhaps when everyone has reduced it, then it will be possible to reduce it to 15, and then to 7... and so, gradually, I believe it would be possible, in the long term, to end human exploitation.\n\nIn any case, it may be impossible for us, as individuals, to achieve perfection in this regard, at least in the world we live in today. But we could improve the situation, which would lay the foundations for future generations to make even greater progress in eradicating slavery.\n\n  \nIn short, I believe that veganism should also fight against human exploitation as a fundamental ideological pillar, without neglecting our fight against the exploitation of non-human animals, of course. I believe we should give equal importance to both issues.\n\n  \n\n\nYou may now be thinking, ‘Okay, but how do we do it?’ I'm glad you asked, friend!\n\nThe first thing is to accept that the fight in this area will be different. We will have to accept a degree of uncertainty about whether slavery has taken place or not. But even so, we can improve our chances of having made an ethical purchase.\n\n  \n\n\nTo begin with, it is important to understand that slavery is associated with low-skilled jobs. Therefore, we only have to worry about products that are manufactured using low-skilled labour. So you don't have to worry about whether an anime was created ethically. Due to the nature of the product, you simply know that it was.\n\nIllustration is a job that requires training, so you can't put an 8-year-old slave child to do it. It's not a good job to use slavery for (it's true that the conditions for illustrators could be improved; they have to work too hard and their pay isn't that high, but they are not SLAVES).\n\n  \n\n\nWhen a product is ‘dangerous’ because it has a high probability that it has been produced unethically, then the best thing to do is simply to stop buying it or look for a ‘safe’ (or safer) alternative to the product.\n\n  \nFor example, adult content featuring real humans is ‘dangerous’, especially on Pornhub, because this content may come from the exploitation of human beings and the majority of platforms that host this content do NOTHING to prevent it.\n\nThis exploitation is particularly terrible due to its nature. Can it be replaced by a safer alternative? Yes, erotic literature and video games/animation for adults do not involve real humans, therefore eliminating the possibility of human exploitation.\n\n  \n\n\nRelated to this, by being vegan, we are already replacing many products with safer alternatives (even if these are not 100% safe either). Even if we disregard animal suffering, meat remains a ‘dangerous’ product from an ethical point of view because it requires to grow more crops to feed one person than if you simply ate soya. That means a greater likelihood of slavery, simply because more people had to work to create this product (low-skilled work). Can meat be replaced by a less ‘dangerous’ product? Yes, soya, seitan and other vegetable proteins.\n\nThe same can be said of all or almost all other animal products.\n\n  \n\n\nAnother thing we should know is that, although it is true that low-skilled jobs are generally at risk of exploitation, not all areas have the same risk. The areas with a higher risk are: the sex industry, the textile industry, electronics and agriculture.\n\n  \n\n\nIt is easy to fight against forced sex work. One can simply avoid consuming products that involve real humans. But things get more complicated in the other cases. One cannot avoid consuming agricultural products, wearing clothes, and, to be honest, owning a computer and/or a mobile phone is practically a necessity.\n\n  \n\n\nTo deal with this situation, I recommend applying the following protocols:\n\n\\- Avoid buying things that are suspiciously cheap.\n\n\\- Try to buy products that come from countries where slavery or semi-slavery is illegal.\n\n\\- Look for brands or products that have labels indicating social commitment or that are part of organisations that fight against human exploitation. Look for labels such as ‘fair wear’ or ‘fairtrade’, among other examples. At the end of the text, I will provide a list of resources, including links to websites with more information about labels.\n\n  \n\n\nIt is not necessary in all cases to comply with all three rules at the same time. For example, if a company pays its workers a decent wage, it does not really matter in which country it is located in. And a very low price could be justified if the company has some kind of new technology that allows it to reduce costs.\n\n  \n\n\nIn the agriculture section, it is better if you never buy coffee, sugar, tea, palm oil or chocolate that does not have these types of labels. If you do, it is almost certain that it comes from slavery, as this is an endemic problem in these industries.\n\nHowever, I understand that it is impossible to know whether the sugar in your oreo was obtained ethically or not. And perhaps it would be “too much” to stop eating anything that contains sugar for fear that it was not obtained ethically? But, at least you can look for the fairtrade label when you buy a bag of sugar.\n\n  \n\n\nOther protocols when deciding what to buy may include:\n\n  \n\n\n\\- Buy from local producers whom you personally know and trust. At the end of the day best thing you can do to reduce slavery is to personally KNOW who was involved in each part of the process and under what conditions.\n\n\\- Support small businesses. Large companies are so big that even if their CEOs were concerned about ethics, they would have a problem locating cases of slavery among the countless people who work for them indirectly.\n\n\\- Check the ratings of companies in apps or websites that analyse whether they are ethical, such as Good on You (link to this and other websites in the resources section). Depending on how strict you want to be, you could either avoid buying brands with the worst ratings (e.g. Temu or Shein) or ONLY buy those with the highest levels of transparency and social welfare. (By the way, Good On You has an app)\n\n  \n\n\nThe best thing to do is find out which brands are trustworthy and which ones to avoid, and simply buy only from the brands that we consider trustworthy. This way, we can avoid the stress of constantly having to check whether a product was made ethically.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping, the internet is our ally: buying online gives us access to many products that we simply would not be able to buy otherwise because there are no shops selling that brand nearby. This makes it easier to buy specifically from ethical brands.\n\n  \n\n\nWith regard to ethical electronics, I must say that for a long time I thought that ethical electronics did not exist. However, I have discovered that, in fact, it does exist, and although it is more expensive, it is still affordable for most people in the developed world, as long as you do not buy a new mobile phone every year.\n\nThe measures to prevent human exploitation in the manufacture of electronic devices are the same as for other things: look for information about the brand and look for labels that certify that they work ethically.\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, not everything revolves around buying new products; there are also other measures we can take to reduce human slavery:\n\n  \n\n\n\\- Buy second-hand.\n\n\\- Buy only what you need.\n\n\\- Repair your belongings instead of buying new ones.\n\n\\- Make what you need yourself: grow your own food, sew your own clothes (even if the fabric comes from unethical sources, you are still avoiding the slavery associated with garment manufacturing). It is possible that if we start sewing our own clothes, out of laziness or inexperience, we will prefer clothes that require few changes to the original fabric. It would also be logical to avoid clothes that are very tight-fitting, as ideally we will have them in our wardrobes for many years and our bodies will change. I will add some images to the resources section that we could use for inspiration bearing these two things in mind.\n\n\\- Give away what you don't need to people you know will use it (With regard to clothing, it's best to give it away in person, as clothes that go into ‘donation’ bins sometimes end up in the rubbish \\[Although, obviously, it is better to put them in the donation bin than in the rubbish bin.\\]), give away surplus food too if you grow it. This way you reduce the amount of stuff others have to buy from these unethical companies.\n\n\\- If a friend grows food and gives it to you, accept it. They probably don't know what to do with all the food they get from their crops, and by accepting it, you not only prevent it from going to waste, but you also avoid having to buy food that may have been produced in unethical ways.\n\n\\- Accept clothes that are given to you. Remember that third world landfills are full of unworn clothing. If you don't accept them, they may simply end up in the rubbish. You are doing a social good by giving those clothes a second life, so don't feel bad about accepting the gift.\n\n\\- Give away electronics you no longer need, and in turn, accept that others give you theirs, even if you are not in financial need.\n\n  \n\n\nRemember that this is not about rich people giving things to poor people. It is about continuing to use things as much as possible and reducing the amount of money these unethical companies receive by avoiding as much as possible buying new products and helping other people to avoid it too.\n\nI will attach some websites used for giving and receiving gifts in the resources section.\n\n  \n\n\nOf course, buying new products that have been made ethically is not a bad thing. But that is not always possible. These measures are very useful when it is impossible to find an ethical company that sells what we want or need.\n\nIt is also useful for saving money, improving social relationships (because everyone likes to give and receive gifts), protecting the poorest people by allowing them to obtain products they could not otherwise afford, helping to combat climate change, and fighting against the hyper-consumerist brainwashing that companies want to subject us to, so that we spend money non-stop.\n\nBasically, many of our problems share the same solution. Perhaps this is because these problems are actually just symptoms of a ‘root problem,’ and the solutions I propose attacks precisely that root problem.\n\n  \n\n\nOn a social level, you can do the following:\n\n\\- Talk about it with other people to increase the number of people fighting against human exploitation.\n\n\\- Participate in organisations that fight against human exploitation, such as Remake World, or at least, stay informed about what these organisations say and do.\n\n\\- If you live in the European Union, keep an eye on the European Citizens' Initiative. It is possible that at some point initiatives that help to combat conditions of slavery or semi-slavery will arise. So it is worth keeping an eye out for them.\n\nIf you do not live in the European Union, find out what methods you have to influence politics as a citizen beyond simply voting (voting will not do much about this issue because the Overton window of current politics practically does not cover this issue).\n\n  \n\n\nAnd finally, I would like to conclude this text by saying that...While is true that, we, the vegans, those who oppose unnecessary suffering and death of sentient beings, must by definition opposehuman slavery…I know, it's very difficult not to end up burnt out when you try to help everyone, solve everything, fight against everything.\n\nSo, please, do what you feel capable of doing and don't demand more of yourself than that. If you demand too much of yourself, in the end you won't be able to keep up the pace and will end up burnt out.\n\nIf you ever feel burnt out, remember that you can choose to be more relaxed rather than simply abandoning the cause.\n\n  \n\n\nThe important thing is that at if we at least consider it important, if we at least try to do what little we can, if we at least talk about it, if we at least have faith that things can get better if we try... I think we could make a difference.\n\nAnd... isn't that what veganism is all about?\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nResources:\n\n\\- [https://english.elpais.com/society/2023-01-03/the-dark-side-of-textiles-my-fingers-were-bleeding-but-they-forced-me-to-work.html](https://english.elpais.com/society/2023-01-03/the-dark-side-of-textiles-my-fingers-were-bleeding-but-they-forced-me-to-work.html)\n\n\\- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery\\_in\\_the\\_21st\\_century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_21st_century)\n\n(For context)\n\n\n\n\\- [https://lucid--collective-eu.translate.goog/en/blogs/le-journal/les-labels-et-certifications-dans-la-mode-durable?\\_x\\_tr\\_sl=en&\\_x\\_tr\\_tl=es&\\_x\\_tr\\_hl=es&\\_x\\_tr\\_pto=tc](https://lucid--collective-eu.translate.goog/en/blogs/le-journal/les-labels-et-certifications-dans-la-mode-durable?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=es&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=tc)\n\n\\- [https://www.fairtradewinds.net/guide-fair-trade-labels/](https://www.fairtradewinds.net/guide-fair-trade-labels/)\n\n\\- [https://goodonyou.eco/best-fair-trade-brands/](https://goodonyou.eco/best-fair-trade-brands/)\n\n\\- [https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/fashion-clothing/quick-guide-fair-trade-fashion](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/fashion-clothing/quick-guide-fair-trade-fashion)\n\n(labels)\n\n\n\n\\- [https://goodonyou.eco/](https://goodonyou.eco/)\n\n\\- [https://ethy.co.uk/](https://ethy.co.uk/) (check the brands verified by ethy)\n\n\\- [https://www.eco-stylist.com/sustainable-brand-criteria/](https://www.eco-stylist.com/sustainable-brand-criteria/)\n\n\\- [https://sustainably-chic.com/sustainable-brands-to-love/](https://sustainably-chic.com/sustainable-brands-to-love/)\n\n(check whether a brand is ethical or not)\n\n\n\n\\- [https://www.ethicalsuperstore.com/](https://www.ethicalsuperstore.com/)\n\n\\- [https://kuyichi.com/](https://kuyichi.com/)\n\n\\- [https://www.quince.com/sustainability](https://www.quince.com/sustainability)\n\n\\- [https://uphavin.com/blogs/technology/the-5-best-ethical-sustainable-electronics-brands-in-europe](https://uphavin.com/blogs/technology/the-5-best-ethical-sustainable-electronics-brands-in-europe)\n\n(some companies that claims to sell ethical products)\n\n\n\n\\- [https://es.pinterest.com/pin/701154235744264498/](https://es.pinterest.com/pin/701154235744264498/)\n\n\\- [https://es.pinterest.com/pin/853713673134751976/](https://es.pinterest.com/pin/853713673134751976/)\n\n\\- [https://es.pinterest.com/pin/697213586096525643/](https://es.pinterest.com/pin/697213586096525643/)\n\n\\- [https://es.pinterest.com/pin/300474606402526896/](https://es.pinterest.com/pin/300474606402526896/)\n\n\\- [https://es.pinterest.com/pin/644577765443546187/](https://es.pinterest.com/pin/644577765443546187/)\n\n(Easy clothes to make.

(A cautionary tale)", "selftext": "TLDR: I basically gave an ultimatum and he ended it. (I was not in a good mental place and will never do this again.)\n\nIn 2023, I (now 31F) experienced the most painful break-up of my life over veganism. I was with this man for 3 years (living together, adopted a dog, mutual love, support, and respect, bright future ahead) when I went vegan nearly overnight after finally opening my eyes and heart to the reality of animal suffering. My heart was raw and I was insecure in my new vegan identity. When I told him about my choice, his first response was \"You're not going to be one of *those* vegans, are you?\" (Since then, I have found compassion for myself and the hurt I felt in that moment, and grace for him who was ignorant of veganism and responding from his lived experience.)  \n  \nAs I wrestled with my vegan identity, I started to feel incredibly lonely and desperate for him to come with me on that journey. I felt so isolated and suddenly othered in a way I hadn't been before. Our relationship, and my attraction to him, was based in part on our shared interest in philosophy, ethics, and curious open-mindedness to challenge our worldviews. From what I knew about him, it was unexpected that he wasn't more open to veganism. From his side, I think he was afraid to consider it, and hung up on emasculating stereotypes, even though he never directly admitted it (he was bullied heavily growing up over those type of things and still had a lot of wounds to heal). On my side, I took his avoidance personally and felt betrayed and abandoned, even though now I'm certain it was never about me.\n\nOver the next six months, his support of my choice strengthened significantly. I explained and he accepted that this was a new but very real and important part of me. (To me, it felt like it was part of me all along.) We learned how to cook plant-based food together, and he ate and enjoyed it every day. He also agreed to keep no meat in the house ever, and limited animal products to a few of his favorite condiments and ice creams. He would defend me if anyone criticized or mocked my veganism to my face or behind my back. I now see how much effort and sacrifice he put in to accommodate my choice. Unfortunately, it was never enough for me.\n\nAs much as he did, I could never get over that he hadn't chosen veganism too. I became more and more touchy and difficult, often getting defensive and argumentative, even when he was being curious and trying to learn more about my beliefs and explore philosophy. I was too impatient and hurt to baby him through it, especially my experience was a sudden undeniable conviction. He started to shut down, and told me he felt like was walking on eggshells around me. Eventually, in a conversation that devolved into yet another heated argument, I impulsively spoke a truth I hadn't even accepted within myself: \"I'm just not attracted to you, *at all!*\"\n\nUnderstandably, he was deeply hurt. His expression with angry tears in his eyes is something I never, ever want to see again on the face of someone I love. He left the house without a word on an hours-long walk, until he came back and asked me to stay with my parents for the week (he was the homeowner). When we spoke again a week later, through tears he told me that he hadn't been happy in a while and needed to end the relationship for his own mental health and wellbeing.\n\nI have held a lot of pain, shame, and regret about how I acted over those months for a long time. Through therapy and growth, I have found grace and forgiveness for myself, and for him, but I still wish I could do it over again. I miss him, I hate that I hurt him, although I don't want to get back together. The breakup was coming regardless (there were other compounding incompatibilities), but in another timeline, it could have been kind, respectful, loving, and compassionate.  \n  \nI was *that* vegan. I was bitter and hostile and completely unforgiving. And it achieved absolutely nothing. Only suffering. Not very vegan of me...\n\nThe other important thing I've accepted recently, finally, is that I can only be attracted to a vegan partner. *Maybe* a person who is curious and open, but I'm aware it's never a good idea to enter a relationship with the *assumption* someone will change. (\"Love the person they are right now.\") I've been terrified to accept this about myself because it essentially cuts my dating pool by nearly 99%. I'm 31 and single, and I really, *really* want to find love. A partner in life. Someone who sees my whole soul and loves me for it and for whom I do the same.\n\nThis last year of active dating (Hinge mostly) has helped make this more apparent. It's easy to be attracted to men when they could *hypothetically* be vegan. I wasn't *actually* deluded that they were all secretly vegan, but there always came a jarring moment when they ordered the chicken sandwich, or the latte with whole milk, or told me how much they just could never give up cheese. I realized I was setting myself up for disappointment over and over. There are better ways to spend my time.   \n  \nI am a proud vegan, and my beliefs guide every decision I make. My closest friends are people who see and love me for who I am and support my decision. When I told them I was going be vegan, they said, \"Yeah, that makes sense for you.\" Then they learned how to cook amazing vegan food, and that's what we all eat when I am together with them. They listen when I feel pain about treatment of animals, and are curious and ask questions. I cherish them deeply, and for now, their love is enough.\n\nSo, here's to clarity, courage, acceptance, and not settling. I encourage you to be honest with yourself about what you need in a partner to feel attracted, safe, and committed. Maybe for you, they don't have to be vegan, or maybe vegetarian is enough, or plant-based, or they cook vegan food for you. The only thing that matters is what is true in your heart, so don't let anyone (including users in this sub, sorry) shame you for what your heart says. \n\nBest of luck to all of us looking for our vegan. <3", "author": "TimeTravelingMouse", "score": 142, "num_comments": 38, "created_utc": 1769114149.0, "permalink": "/r/vegan/comments/1qk5zjc/please_be_honest_with_yourself_about_what_your/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1qk5zjc/please_be_honest_with_yourself_about_what_your/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "confidence": 0.5203678607940674, "compound_score": -0.4814, "scores": {"negative": 0.5204, "neutral": 0.4406, "positive": 0.039}}}, {"post": {"id": "1r1j5js", "subreddit": "vegan", "title": "Free Frog Dissection Alternatives For Qualified Educators", "selftext": "https://www.teachkind.org/free-kind-frogs/\n\n\"TeachKind Science is proud to offer the Kind Frog—a dissectible, silicone-based frog designed by teachers, for teachers that delivers an innovative, hands-on learning experience.

My omnivore dad defended dietary fiber in a room full of staunch carnivores.\n\nI was a vegetarian for 15 years and went fully vegan in August last year. In October I moved from NYC to rural Tennessee to stay with my dad for a while after my mom passed and I lost my job. He's a MAGA evangelical right-wing conservative, but he's a big proponent of fiber. For 10 years in the 1970's we lived on the Thai-Burma border in a remote hilltribe area where he observed that a high-fiber diet of mostly rice and vegetables and small amounts of meat just for flavor resulted in a population with no heart disease, cancer, diabetes or digestive ailments like diverticulitis.\n\nWhen we moved back to the States, he learned that his observations were backed up by the research of Dr. Denis Burkitt, a docter who spent time in East Africa in the 1960's and observed the same thing father had seen in Thailand: a high-fiber diet seemed to have an undeniable correlation to preventing many conditions associated with the \"western diet\".\n\nFast forward to now, and my left wing, liberal, vegan self has moved in for a while and I'm trying out all kinds of recipes because I like to cook and he's always been obsessed with fiber, so this is something we enjoy. I've even gotten him to watch a few vegan documentaries like \"What the Health\" and it's exciting for him to see some of his ideas validated there. I don't think he's going to become vegan, but when I'm the one cooking, he's kind of mostly vegan now. haha\n\nAnyway, he heard from pentacostal prayer group friends about a speaking event on the carnivore diet at a local church and asked if I wanted to check it out. Sure, lets go. \n\nSo last night we went and the auditorium was well-attended. The speaker was Dr. Ken Berry who name-dropped his friend Kirk Cameron and was a very charismatic. The crowd was mostly older people, and frankly not the healthiest looking people in town, but they were enthusiastic supporters. He described the diet, which is the opposite of what my dad has always espoused. And then he quickly moved to Q&A.\n\nMy dad gets the mic and talks about his observations in Thailand and Berry says that it's not about the diet, it's because these people are close to starvation. My dad explained that even remote parts of Thailand have great abundance in natural resources and readily available food. Starvation has never been an issue in any part of Thailand.  But Berry gets my dad to acknowledge that Thai people eat fish, villagers all keep chickens and pigs, and so he tried to turn around that they actually eat more meat than my dad was letting on. \n\nSo I take the mic since I'm right next to him and raise a couple of points:  \n1. Americans eat 3 times more meat than the global diet and we're the unhealthiest people on the planet. So essentially we're all on the carnivore diet and it's not working.\n\n2. Since Berry mentioned that the carnivore diet reverses diabetes, can he point to medical studies that back that up? Because a study from 2023 found that a plant-based diet stopped progression or reversed diabetes in a third of the population.\n\nBerry said that Americans aren't on a true carnivore diet - they're not eating enough meat?!? and in response to 2 - he said that's the problem right there - scientific studies. He said that scientific studies don't mean anything. He relies on common sense.  To applause from the roomful of antivaxers. He also said, look at who funded that study - big Pharma. ?!?\n\nAnyway, for the rest of the evening, Berry would occasionally refer to my dad \"that doctor\" mockingly. Later I realized that this was humiliating and embarrassing for him because he's a well respected figure in the community. And despite all the interesting experiences he's had, he's not the best speaker. So he had to watch this guy with all kinds of nonsense ideas commmand the room and use him as a running punch line, while he had no real rhetorical means to defend himself. \n\nAnyway, I was kind of fascinated. There were a couple of people who had been vegan and learned the error of their ways. One woman said she had been an influencer as an alkaline vegan and chef and had never been unhealthier until she became carnivore and lost 80 pounds. Something about this didn't really add up to me because i've never felt better. Various other testimonials including a guy who visited his doctor and had scans that revealed plaques on his brain and a diagnosis of MS (I think?). The doctor told him that if he hadn't been carnivore he would have been dead by now. ! \n\nAt least 20 people said they had lost weight ranging from 10 pounds to 80 pounds. A woman asked, \"What do I tell my doctor who doesn't understand the carnivore diet when my cholesterol is through the roof?\" I had to keep from laughing out loud at that one. Berry responded that it's a myth that high cholesterol is bad.\n\nI can't accurately summarize this without bringing up the many Biblical references that peppered the night. This was a creationist audience, but Berry believed in evolution too, because he wanted to demonstrate that our bodies evolved to eat meat. A woman addressed me and talked about a verse in Genesis that says God put all the creatures on the Earth for us to eat. And interestingly, a woman asked a question about other verses which mention that God put grains and plants for us to eat and that the diet in Biblical times included bread and plants.  \n\nThere were some things he said that I agreed with - that processed foods are bad. And suprisingly he was against dairy milk because humans aren't designed to drink cow milk. He shocked the audience by telling them that most people in the word are lactose intolerant and that only Europeans have built up a resistance to it over time. Which doesn't mean we should be drinking it. A poison you've learned to tolerate is still not good for you. But strangly he was all for butter...?\n\nThe audience was enthralled but it was time to wrap up when he gave a quick sales pitch to join his online community for $30 a month.\n\nOn the way home, my dad and I discussed the weight loss and agreed that any kind of limiting diet will result in weight loss because the tedium of eating the same thing will result in only eating when you need to and cut down on recreational eating. And weight loss will bring some health benefits in the short term. \n\nHe wasn't converted.  And neither was I. the guy was giving charlatan / snake-oil salesman vibes. But it was interesting seeing this part of the culture. And I'm proud of my dad for speaking up.", "author": "FreemanWorldHoldings", "score": 86, "num_comments": 27, "created_utc": 1769024408.0, "permalink": "/r/vegan/comments/1qj7xbl/my_night_as_a_vegan_at_a_carnivore_seminar_hosted/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1qj7xbl/my_night_as_a_vegan_at_a_carnivore_seminar_hosted/"}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.5401397943496704, "compound_score": 0.4253, "scores": {"negative": 0.0173, "neutral": 0.5401, "positive": 0.4426}}}, {"post": {"id": "1qewh43", "subreddit": "vegan", "title": "What are your thoughts on people who don't go vegan even after learning the truth?", "selftext": "I'm talking about people who know about the cruelty of animal exploitation, know about the health/environmental benefits and yet refuse to take steps to go vegan even if it's gradually.

But in a legal and marketing sense, the policing of the word ‘milk’ has a lot of financial implications. Any time you can force your competitors to have to spend money on relabeling, likely pulling products off shelves, or simply the extra expense of ordering new packaging, it is less money going towards marketing and advertising of these milk alternatives. I could see it as having downstream effects of forcing grocery stores to move products out of the dairy/milk section until new signage can be made.\n\nMy other guess is that the dairy industry is planning on upping the prices for milk/forcast their costs going up, so they likely see the writing on the wall that the plant based milks will soon be very competitive on price. So if you kick the plant based milk products out of the party, they will use the “milk” label as a simple way to signal the “supremacy” of their product and devalue the actual products of greater value for their cost. \n\nThis is why I think this seemingly frivolous lawsuit and others of its kind are worse than they are on paper.", "author": "plantbasedgodmode", "score": 20, "created_utc": 1770838990.0}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "confidence": 0.5057872533798218, "compound_score": -0.4477, "scores": {"negative": 0.471, "neutral": 0.5058, "positive": 0.0232}}}, {"comment": {"id": "o4vp3yl", "post_id": "1r24taj", "subreddit": "vegan", "body": "Speaking of fascists, boo to OP for posting gbnews as a source.

odds with its core values. Yet, amidst this negativity, a clear and unwavering beacon shines: the profound commitment to **help animals**. This isn't merely a preference; it's the very bedrock of their collective identity, often forged and reinforced by the visceral experience of watching the documentary *Dominion*. This powerful film appears to serve as a shared awakening, grounding many in their ethical stance.\n\nHowever, even with such a strong moral compass, the path isn't always clear. The community finds itself wrestling with definitions, particularly the often-thorny relationship between being **\"plant based\"** and truly vegan. This isn't just semantics; it's a fundamental debate about the scope and purity of their movement, leading to significant internal disagreement. This identity struggle extends to figures like \"Gary,\" whose polarizing activism divides opinion on tactics and messaging. Externally, the community directs sharp criticism at entities perceived as disingenuous or hypocritical. **Starbucks**, for instance, faces a united front of rejection, embodying the frustration with corporations that offer plant-based options but are seen as fundamentally misaligned with animal welfare. In contrast, **NutritionFacts.org** stands as a universally celebrated source, providing trusted, science-backed information, perhaps offering a stable anchor in an otherwise contentious landscape.",

Amazing vegan restaurants provide positive visibility for veganism, meeting space for the community and the money is used in the best way for veganism.
